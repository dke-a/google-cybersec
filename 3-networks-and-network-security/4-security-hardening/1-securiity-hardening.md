# Security Hardening

Security analysts and the organizations they work with have to be proactive about protecting systems from attack. This is where security hardening comes in.

## Definition
Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface. The attack surface encompasses all potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

### Example
- **Network as a House**: The attack surface would be all the doors and windows that a robber could use to gain access. Security hardening involves minimizing the attack surface or potential vulnerabilities, akin to putting locks on all doors and windows.

## Regular Maintenance Procedures
Security hardening involves regular maintenance to ensure network devices and systems function securely and optimally. It can be conducted on any device or system that can be compromised, such as:
- Hardware
- Operating systems
- Applications
- Computer networks
- Databases

### Physical Security
Physical security is also part of security hardening, which includes measures like security cameras and security guards.

## Common Hardening Procedures
### Software Updates (Patches)
- **Purpose**: Increase security and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Example**: Applying patches to software to address known security issues.

### Configuration Changes
- **Example**: Requiring longer passwords or more frequent password changes to make it harder for malicious actors to gain login credentials.
- **Example**: Updating encryption standards for data stored in a database to make it harder for malicious actors to access the data.

### Removing or Disabling Unused Applications and Services
- **Purpose**: Reduces the attack surface by minimizing the number of potential entry points for attackers.

### Disabling Unused Ports
- **Purpose**: Limits the number of ways an attacker can access the network.

### Reducing Access Permissions
- **Purpose**: Limits the access that users and devices have to sensitive areas of the network, making monitoring more efficient and reducing the overall attack surface.

## Penetration Testing
### Definition
A penetration test, or pen test, is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in a system, network, website, application, or process.

### Process
- **Simulation**: Conduct a simulated attack to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Documentation**: Penetration testers document their findings in a report.
- **Analysis**: Security teams analyze where the test fails to determine the vulnerabilities.
- **Remediation Plan**: Organizations review the vulnerabilities and develop a plan to fix them.

## Key Takeaways
Security hardening is an essential aspect of securing networks. It involves a variety of strategies to reduce the attack surface and ensure the network is protected against potential threats. By conducting regular maintenance, applying patches, configuring systems securely, removing unnecessary services, reducing permissions, and performing penetration tests, organizations can significantly strengthen their defenses against cyber attacks.
