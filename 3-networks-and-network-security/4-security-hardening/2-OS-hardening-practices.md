# OS Hardening Practices

In this section, we'll discuss operating system (OS) hardening and its importance in keeping the entire network secure. The OS acts as an interface between computer hardware and the user and is the first program loaded when a computer turns on. Securing the OS in each system is crucial because one insecure OS can compromise the whole network. Despite the various types of operating systems, they share similar security hardening practices. Here are some recommended OS hardening practices.

## Regular Interval Tasks

### Patch Updates
- **Definition**: A patch update is a software and OS update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.
- **Importance**: When OS vendors publish a patch, they also publish information about the vulnerability it fixes. This alerts malicious actors to the vulnerability, which is why organizations should apply patch updates as soon as they are released.
- **Baseline Configuration**: The newly updated OS should be added to the baseline configuration, which is a documented set of specifications used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates. A baseline can help detect unusual activity by comparing the current configuration to the baseline.

### Hardware and Software Disposal
- **Purpose**: Ensures that all old hardware is properly wiped and disposed of.
- **Unused Software**: Deleting unused software applications to eliminate unnecessary vulnerabilities associated with the programs they use.

### Strong Password Policies
- **Rules**: Password policies require that passwords follow specific rules, such as a minimum of eight characters, including a capital letter, a number, and a symbol.
- **Account Lockout**: Policies usually state that a user will lose access to the network after entering the wrong password a certain number of times in a row.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is a security measure requiring a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. This can include something you know (password), something you have (ID card), or something unique about you (fingerprint).

## Preliminary Safety Measures

### Secure Encryption Standards
- **Configuration**: Device settings should be configured to fit secure encryption standards to protect data.

## Key Takeaways
OS hardening is a set of procedures that maintains and improves OS security. Regular tasks include applying patch updates, properly disposing of hardware and software, and implementing strong password policies. These measures, along with baseline configurations and secure encryption standards, help protect the OS and, by extension, the entire network from vulnerabilities and attacks.
