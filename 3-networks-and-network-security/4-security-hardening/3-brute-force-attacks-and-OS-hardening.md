# Brute Force Attacks and OS Hardening

In this reading, youâ€™ll learn about brute force attacks, how vulnerabilities can be assessed using virtual machines and sandboxes, and ways to prevent brute force attacks using a combination of authentication measures. Implementing various OS hardening tasks can help prevent brute force attacks. An attacker can use a brute force attack to gain access and compromise a network.

## Brute Force Attacks

### Definition
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information by guessing passwords or encryption keys. Attackers use various techniques to guess passwords, including simple brute force attacks and dictionary attacks.

### Types of Brute Force Attacks
- **Simple Brute Force Attacks**: Attackers guess a user's login credentials by entering combinations of usernames and passwords until they find one that works.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. This method is named because it originally used words from the dictionary to guess passwords.

### Tools Used in Brute Force Attacks
- **Automated Software Tools**: Attackers often use automated tools to speed up the process of guessing passwords and reduce the time and effort involved in brute force attacks.

## Assessing Vulnerabilities

### Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **Definition**: VMs are software versions of physical computers that provide an isolated environment for running code.
- **Uses**: VMs are useful for testing potentially malicious code, investigating infected machines, and running malware in a constrained environment. VMs can be deleted and replaced with a pristine image after testing.
- **Risks**: There is a small risk that malicious programs can escape virtualization and access the host machine.

### Sandbox Environments
- **Definition**: A sandbox is a testing environment that allows software or programs to be executed separately from the network.
- **Uses**: Sandboxes are used for testing patches, identifying bugs, detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and simulating attack scenarios.
- **Risks**: Some malware can detect if it is running in a VM or sandbox environment and behave harmlessly, making detection more challenging.

## Prevention Measures

### Salting and Hashing
- **Hashing**: Converts information into a unique value that cannot be decrypted to obtain the original text.
- **Salting**: Adds random characters to hashed passwords to increase their length and complexity, making them more secure.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **MFA**: Requires a user to verify their identity using a combination of authentication factors such as passwords, fingerprints, facial recognition, or one-time passwords (OTP).
- **2FA**: A type of MFA that uses only two forms of verification.

### CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA
- **CAPTCHA**: A test that distinguishes between humans and bots, preventing automated software from brute forcing passwords.
- **reCAPTCHA**: A free CAPTCHA service from Google that helps protect websites from bots and malicious software.

### Password Policies
- **Guidelines**: Policies include guidelines on password complexity, update frequency, reuse restrictions, and login attempt limits before account suspension.

## Key Takeaways
- **Brute Force Attacks**: A trial-and-error method of guessing passwords, which can be done manually or through software tools.
- **Assessing Vulnerabilities**: Using sandboxes and virtual machines to test suspicious files, check for vulnerabilities, and simulate attacks.
- **Prevention Measures**: Implementing salting and hashing, MFA/2FA, CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA, and strong password policies to protect against brute force attacks.

These practices help secure systems and prevent unauthorized access through brute force attacks.
