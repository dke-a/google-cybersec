# The TCP/IP Model

## Overview
In this section, you'll learn about the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, which is the standard model used for network communication. This model outlines how devices communicate with each other across the internet.

## TCP/IP Definitions
### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- **Definition**: An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.
- **Functions**:
  - Organizes data for transmission across a network.
  - Establishes a connection between two devices.
  - Ensures data packets reach their appropriate destination.

### Internet Protocol (IP)
- **Definition**: A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.
- **Functions**:
  - Provides IP addresses, which function as addresses for each private network.
  - Routes data packets to their correct destinations.

## Ports and Data Packets
### Port Definition
- **Definition**: A software-based location within the operating system of a network device that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.
- **Function**: Divides network traffic into segments based on the service they will perform between two devices.
- **Analogy**: Like sending a letter to a friend in an apartment building; the mail delivery person knows the building and the specific apartment number.

### Common Port Numbers
- **Port 25**: Used for email communication.
- **Port 443**: Used for secure internet communication (HTTPS).
- **Port 20**: Used for large file transfers (FTP).

## Key Concepts
### Data Packets
- **Definition**: Basic units of information that travel from one device to another within a network.
- **Contents**:
  - **Header**: Includes IP and MAC addresses, and protocol number.
  - **Body**: Contains the message being transmitted.
  - **Footer**: Signals the end of the packet.

### Bandwidth and Speed
- **Bandwidth**: The amount of data a device receives every second. Calculated by dividing the quantity of data by the time in seconds.
- **Speed**: The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded.
- **Importance**: Irregular bandwidth or speed can indicate potential network attacks.

### Packet Sniffing
- **Definition**: The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across the network.

## Summary
- **TCP/IP Model**: Essential for network communication, ensuring data is organized, transmitted, and received accurately.
- **Ports**: Help in managing and prioritizing network traffic.
- **Data Packets**: Contain crucial information for the transmission and reception of data across a network.
- **Bandwidth and Speed**: Important metrics for network performance and security.
