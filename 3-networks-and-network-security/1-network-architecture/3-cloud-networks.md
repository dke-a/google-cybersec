# Cloud Networks

## Introduction
Companies traditionally managed their network devices on-premises, but now many are turning to third-party providers to manage their networks. This shift helps companies save money and access more network resources, thanks to the growth of cloud computing.

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing involves using remote servers, applications, and network services hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices. The number of businesses using cloud computing is increasing annually, making it crucial to understand how cloud networks function and how to secure them.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces the need for physical infrastructure and maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Provides access to more network resources on demand.
- **Flexibility**: Allows access to services and applications from any geographic location.

## Cloud Networks
A cloud network is a collection of servers or computers storing resources and data in a remote data center accessible via the internet. Unlike traditional networks that host web servers on physical locations, cloud networks use remote servers, making them accessible from anywhere.

### Key Characteristics
- **Remote Servers**: Servers are not housed at the company's physical location but are "in the cloud".
- **Accessibility**: Online services and web applications can be used from any geographic location.
- **Cloud Security**: As more organizations migrate to cloud services, cloud security becomes increasingly relevant.

## Cloud Service Providers
Cloud service providers maintain applications and offer on-demand storage and processing power. Customers only pay for what they use. They also provide business and web analytics for monitoring web traffic and sales.

### Examples of Cloud Services
- **On-Demand Storage**: Scalable storage solutions without the need for physical hardware.
- **Processing Power**: High-performance computing resources available as needed.
- **Business and Web Analytics**: Tools for monitoring and analyzing web traffic and business metrics.

## Security in Cloud Networks
With the transition to cloud networking, there is an overlap of identity-based security on top of traditional network-based solutions. This means security professionals must verify both the origin of the traffic and the identity associated with it.

### Importance of Cloud Security
- **Identity Verification**: Ensuring the identity of users accessing the network.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Verifying where the traffic is coming from.
- **Simplified Operations**: Cloud services help streamline network management and security.

## Key Takeaways
- **Cloud Computing**: Using remote servers and services hosted on the internet.
- **Cost and Resource Efficiency**: Cloud networks save money and provide scalable resources.
- **Cloud Security**: As organizations move to the cloud, securing these networks becomes critical.
- **Identity-Based Security**: Combining traditional network security with identity verification.

Cloud networks offer numerous advantages, including cost savings, scalability, and flexibility. However, with these benefits come new security challenges that require a shift in focus towards identity-based security and continuous monitoring of cloud environments.
