# Cloud Computing and Software-Defined Networks

## Overview
In this section, you’ve been learning the basic architecture of networks, including physical network devices like workstations, servers, routers, and switches. Networks may cover small geographical areas, as in a local area network (LAN), or span large geographic areas, like in a wide area network (WAN). You also learned about cloud networks and the growing significance of cloud computing.

This reading will further explore the concepts of cloud computing, hybrid networks, and software-defined networks (SDNs). It will also cover the benefits of hosting networks in the cloud and why this is advantageous for large organizations.

## Computing Processes in the Cloud
### Traditional Networks
- **On-premise Networks**: All devices used for network operations are kept at a physical location owned by the company.

### Cloud Computing
- **Definition**: The practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services hosted on the internet.
- **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)**: A company offering cloud computing services through large data centers located globally.

### CSP Services

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
   - Software suites operated by the CSP and used remotely without hosting the software.
2. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
   - Virtual computer components offered by the CSP, including virtual containers and storage, configured remotely.
3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
   - Tools for application developers to design custom applications for their company, used for specific business needs.

## Hybrid Cloud Environments
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Using a CSP’s services alongside on-premise computers, networks, and storage.
- **Multi-Cloud Environment**: Using services from more than one CSP.

## Software-Defined Networks (SDNs)
- **Definition**: Networks made up of virtual network devices and services.
- **Functionality**: Provide virtual switches, routers, firewalls, and more, hosted on servers at the CSP’s data center.
- **Modern Network Hardware**: Supports network virtualization and software-defined networking, performing packet routing through software.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing and Software-Defined Networks
### Reliability
- **Availability**: Consistent access to cloud services and resources.
- **Secure Connections**: Ensures protected data transmission.
- **Minimal Interruptions**: Services run effectively with minimal downtime.

### Cost
- **Reduced Upfront Costs**: No need for significant investment in physical infrastructure.
- **Fraction of the Cost**: CSPs offer services at a fraction of the cost compared to self-managed components and software.

### Scalability
- **Elastic Utility Model**: Companies pay only for what they need, when they need it.
- **Quick Adjustments**: Changes can be made swiftly through CSPs' APIs or web consoles.

## Key Takeaways
- **Cloud Computing**: Involves using remote servers and services hosted on the internet.
- **SDNs**: Virtual network devices and services managed programmatically.
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability, cost savings, and scalability.

In this reading, you learned more about cloud computing and cloud networking. You learned that CSPs are companies that own large data centers housing millions of servers globally, providing modern technology services, including compute, storage, and networking, through the internet. SDNs enable dynamic, programmatically efficient network configurations to improve network performance and monitoring. Organizations can improve reliability, save costs, and scale quickly by using CSPs to provide networking services instead of building and maintaining their own network infrastructure.
