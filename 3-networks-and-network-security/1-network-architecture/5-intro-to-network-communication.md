# Introduction to Network Communication

## Overview
Networks help organizations communicate and connect, facilitating the transfer of data and resources. However, network communication also makes network attacks more likely as it provides malicious actors opportunities to exploit vulnerable devices and unprotected networks.

## Data Packets
### Definition
- **Data Packet**: A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network.

### Structure of a Data Packet
- **Header**:
  - Contains the internet protocol address (IP address) and the media access control (MAC) address of the destination device.
  - Includes a protocol number that instructs the receiving device on what to do with the information in the packet.
- **Body**:
  - Contains the message that needs to be transmitted to the receiving device.
- **Footer**:
  - Signals to the receiving device that the packet is finished, similar to a signature on a letter.

### Analogy
- **Physical Mail**:
  - **Envelope**: Contains the destination address and return address.
  - **Letter Inside**: Contains the message to be read by the recipient.
  - Similar to a data packet's header, body, and footer.

## Network Performance
### Bandwidth
- **Definition**: The amount of data a device receives every second.
- **Calculation**: Bandwidth is calculated by dividing the quantity of data by the time in seconds.

### Speed
- **Definition**: The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded.

### Importance in Security
- **Irregular Bandwidth and Speed**: Any irregularities in bandwidth or speed could indicate a network attack.

### Packet Sniffing
- **Definition**: The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across the network.

## Importance of Network Communication
- **Resource Sharing**: Facilitates the sharing of resources and data, enabling organizations to function effectively.

## Key Takeaways
- Network communication involves the transfer of data packets, which are crucial for the functioning of organizations.
- Data packets have a structured format that includes a header, body, and footer.
- Bandwidth and speed are important metrics for measuring network performance and detecting potential attacks.
- Packet sniffing is used to capture and inspect data packets for security analysis.
