# Proxy Servers

## Overview
- **Proxy Server Definition**: A server that fulfills client requests by forwarding them to other servers. It acts as an intermediary between the internet and the internal network.
  - **Function**: Determines the safety of incoming connection requests, hiding the private network's IP address from malicious actors and adding a layer of security.

## Functionality and Benefits
- **Public vs. Private IP**: The proxy server has a public IP address different from the rest of the private network, adding a layer of security by hiding the internal IP addresses.
- **Example**:
  - **HTTPS Responses**: Clients see a distorted or no IP address instead of the real IP address of the organization's web server.
  - **Blocking Unsafe Websites**: Proxy servers can block access to unsafe websites on an organization's network.
  - **Caching**: Uses temporary memory to store frequently requested data, reducing the need to fetch data from internal servers and enhancing security.

## Types of Proxy Servers
- **Forward Proxy Server**: 
  - **Purpose**: Regulates and restricts a person's access to the internet.
  - **Function**: Hides the user's IP address, approves outgoing requests, and forwards them to the internet.
  - **Use Case**: In an organization, it receives outgoing traffic from employees, approves it, and forwards it to the destination on the internet.
  
- **Reverse Proxy Server**: 
  - **Purpose**: Regulates and restricts internet access to internal servers.
  - **Function**: Accepts traffic from external parties, approves it, and forwards it to internal servers.
  - **Use Case**: Protects internal web servers with confidential data by hiding their IP addresses from external parties.

- **Email Proxy Server**: 
  - **Purpose**: Filters spam emails by verifying the authenticity of the sender's address.
  - **Function**: Reduces the risk of phishing attacks by impersonating known individuals.
  - **Real-World Example**: A large U.S. broadband ISP used proxy servers for anti-spam filtering, tagging around 95% of messages as spam, allowing scalable filtering without impacting the underlying email platform.

## Security Role of Proxy Servers
- **Filtering Traffic**: Proxy servers filter incoming and outgoing traffic, ensuring only safe connections are made.
- **Alert to Network Attacks**: They help in monitoring for potential network attacks.
- **Layer of Protection**: Adds a layer of protection from the unsecured public network (internet).

## Key Takeaways
- **Proxy Servers**: Essential for securing networks by filtering traffic and hiding internal IP addresses.
- **Types of Proxies**: Includes forward proxies, reverse proxies, and email proxies, each serving specific security functions.
- **Real-World Application**: Proxy servers are used to implement layers of security, such as anti-spam filtering, protecting internal servers, and regulating internet access.
