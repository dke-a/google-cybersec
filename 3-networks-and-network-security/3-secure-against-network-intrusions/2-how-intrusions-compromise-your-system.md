# How Intrusions Compromise Your System

## Introduction
Every network has inherent vulnerabilities and could become the target of a network attack. Attackers can have varying motivations, including financial, personal, political, or even being disgruntled employees or activists. Security analysts must be constantly alert to potential vulnerabilities and take quick action to mitigate them.

## Types of Network Attacks

### Network Interception Attacks
- **Definition**: Intercepting network traffic to steal information or interfere with transmission.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Malicious actors use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit.
  - **Example**: Intercepting a bank transfer and changing the receiving account to one controlled by the attacker.
- **Types of Network Interception Attacks**:
  - **On-Path Attacks**: Intercepting communication between two parties to alter or steal data.
  - **Replay Attacks**: Reusing intercepted data to perform unauthorized actions.

### Backdoor Attacks
- **Definition**: Exploiting intentionally or unintentionally created weaknesses that bypass normal access controls.
- **Purpose**: Originally intended for troubleshooting or administrative tasks.
- **Consequences**:
  - Installing malware
  - Performing denial of service (DoS) attacks
  - Stealing private information
  - Changing security settings to leave the system vulnerable

## Possible Impacts on an Organization

### Financial Impacts
- **Operational Interruptions**: DoS attacks or other tactics can prevent revenue-generating activities.
- **Reparation Costs**: Rebuilding infrastructure and paying ransomware can be financially burdensome.
- **Litigation**: Breaches leading to the exposure of client information can result in legal and settlement costs.

### Reputation Damage
- **Public Trust**: Cyber attacks can erode public confidence in the organization's security practices.
- **Customer Retention**: Loss of trust can drive customers to competitors.

### Public Safety Risks
- **Government Networks**: Attacks on these networks can impact the safety and welfare of citizens.
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Malicious access to power grids, water systems, or military communication systems can cause physical harm.

## Key Takeaways
- **Constant Vigilance**: Security analysts must continuously monitor for vulnerabilities and exploit attempts.
- **Impact Awareness**: Understanding the financial, reputational, and public safety impacts of attacks is crucial.
- **Education and Training**: Staying educated on new vulnerabilities and attack methods is essential to maintaining network safety and reducing the impact of attacks.

Securing networks has never been more important. Malicious actors are always looking for ways to exploit systems, and it is up to security analysts to stay ahead of these threats.
