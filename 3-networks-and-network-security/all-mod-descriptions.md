## Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

**by Google**

**About this Course**

This is the third course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These courses will equip you with the skills you need to apply for an entry-level cybersecurity job. Youâ€™ll build on your understanding of the topics that were introduced in the second Google Cybersecurity Certificate course.

**In this course, you will explore:**

- How networks connect multiple devices and allow them to communicate.
- The fundamentals of modern networking operations and protocols, including the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model.
- How network hardware, like routers and modems, allow your computer to send and receive information on the internet.
- Network security, a crucial aspect as organizations rely heavily on networks for storing and transmitting sensitive information.
- How to identify network vulnerabilities and explore methods to secure networks using firewalls, system hardening, and virtual private networks (VPNs).

**Learning with Google:**

- Benefit from the expertise of Google cybersecurity professionals who will guide you through video lectures.
- Participate in hands-on activities and real-world examples that simulate common cybersecurity tasks.

**Course Outcomes:**

- Describe the structure of different computer networks.
- Illustrate how data is sent and received over a network.
- Recognize commonly used network protocols.
- Identify standard network security measures and protocols.
- Explain methods for securing networks against intrusion attempts.
- Differentiate between local networks and cloud computing environments.
- Understand different system hardening techniques.
