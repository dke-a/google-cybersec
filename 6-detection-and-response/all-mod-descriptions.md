## About this Course

This is the sixth course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate series. These courses equip you with the skills you need to apply for an entry-level cybersecurity job. Building on topics introduced in the fifth course, this course focuses on incident detection and response.

In this course, you will:

- Define a security incident and explain the incident response lifecycle, including the roles and responsibilities of incident response teams.
- Analyze and interpret network communications to detect security incidents using packet sniffing tools to capture network traffic.
- Explore the incident investigation and response processes and procedures by assessing and analyzing artifacts.
- Practice using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information Event Management (SIEM) tools.

Google employees working in cybersecurity will guide you through videos, hands-on activities, and examples that simulate common cybersecurity tasks. This will help you build your skills to prepare for jobs.

No previous experience is necessary.

### By the end of this course, you will:

- Explain the lifecycle of an incident.
- Describe the tools used in documentation, detection, and management of incidents.
- Analyze packets to interpret network communications.
- Perform artifact investigations to analyze and verify security incidents.
- Identify the steps to contain, eradicate, and recover from an incident.
- Determine how to read and analyze logs during incident investigation.
- Interpret the basic syntax and components of signatures and logs in IDS and Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) tools.
- Perform queries in SIEM tools to investigate an event.
