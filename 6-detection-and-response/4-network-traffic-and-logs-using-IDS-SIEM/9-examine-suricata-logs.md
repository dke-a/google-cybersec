# Examine Suricata Logs

In this session, we will explore logs generated by Suricata, an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Suricata generates two main types of logs: **alert logs** and **network telemetry logs**. These logs are output in a format known as **EVE JSON**, which stands for Extensible Event Format using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON uses key-value pairs, simplifying both searching and extracting text from log files.

## Types of Suricata Logs

### 1. **Alert Logs**

- **Purpose**: Contain information relevant to security investigations.
- **Generation**: Typically the output of signatures that have triggered an alert.
- **Example**: A signature that detects suspicious network traffic generates an alert log capturing details of that traffic.
- **Details**: Include information such as IP addresses, protocols, signature messages, and IDs. For instance, an alert might indicate the detection of malware based on specific traffic patterns.

### 2. **Network Telemetry Logs**

- **Purpose**: Record information about network traffic flows. While not always directly security-relevant, they provide a broader picture of network activity.
- **Example**: An HTTP request log detailing a connection to a website.
- **Details**: Include event types (e.g., `http log`), hostnames (the website accessed), user agents (e.g., Mozilla 5.0 as the web browser), and content types (e.g., HTML text returned by the HTTP request).

## Example Logs Breakdown

### **Event Log (Alert Example)**

- **Event Type**: `alert` (indicating it is an alert log).

- Details

  :

  - IP addresses involved.
  - Protocol used.
  - Signature details, such as the message and ID.

- **Example**: An alert indicating the detection of malware on the network.

### **Network Telemetry Log (HTTP Example)**

- **Event Type**: `http log` (indicating it is a network telemetry log).

- Details

  :

  - **Hostname**: The website accessed.
  - **User Agent**: The software used to connect (e.g., Mozilla 5.0).
  - **Content Type**: The type of data returned by the HTTP request (e.g., HTML text).

## Key Takeaways

- **Alert Logs**: Critical for security investigations, capturing suspicious or malicious activities detected by Suricata.
- **Network Telemetry Logs**: Useful for understanding general network behavior and can be correlated with alert logs during an investigation.
- **EVE JSON Format**: Facilitates easy searching and extraction of relevant details due to its structured key-value pair format.

These logs provide the foundation for building a narrative during security investigations, helping analysts understand what happened, how, and why.
