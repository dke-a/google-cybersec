# Reexamine SIEM Tools

As a security analyst, you'll need to quickly access relevant data to perform various duties, such as triaging alerts, monitoring systems, or analyzing log data during incident investigations. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools are essential for this purpose.

## What is a SIEM?

A SIEM is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. It achieves this by collecting, analyzing, and reporting on security data from multiple sources.

### SIEM Process Overview

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
   - SIEM tools collect enormous amounts of data generated by devices and systems throughout an environment.
   - The challenge is that devices generate data in different formats, with no unified format representing the data.
2. **Normalization**:
   - Raw data is processed and normalized, meaning it is formatted consistently, and only relevant event information is included.
   - This makes the data easier to read and analyze.
3. **Indexing**:
   - After normalization, the data is indexed so that it can be accessed through a search function.
   - This means that all the events across different sources can be quickly accessed and analyzed.

### Importance of SIEM Tools

SIEM tools simplify the process of accessing and analyzing data flows across networks within an environment. As a security analyst, you may encounter different SIEM tools, and it’s important to be adaptable to whichever tool your organization uses.

### Commonly Used SIEM Tools

- **Splunk**:
  - Splunk is a data analysis platform offering SIEM solutions under Splunk Enterprise Security.
  - It collects data from various sources, processes and stores the data in an index, making it accessible for search, analysis, and visualization.
- **Chronicle**:
  - Chronicle is Google Cloud’s SIEM solution.
  - It forwards data to Chronicle, where the data is normalized (cleaned up) to make it easier to process and index.
  - The data can then be accessed through a search bar.
