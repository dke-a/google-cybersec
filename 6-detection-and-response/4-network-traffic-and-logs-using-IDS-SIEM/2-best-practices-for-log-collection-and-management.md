# Best Practices for Log Collection and Management

Understanding the best practices for log collection and management is essential for effective incident detection and response. Logs are records of events that occur within an organizationâ€™s systems and provide critical insights into the "who," "what," "when," "where," and "why" of security incidents.

## Logs and Their Importance

Logs consist of entries that capture details about events occurring within systems or devices. They were initially used for troubleshooting common technology issues, but now they are pivotal in security monitoring and investigation. Logs help uncover crucial details during an incident investigation, supporting security teams in analyzing the context of events.

### Types of Logs

Different data sources generate various log types:

- **Network Logs**: Generated by devices like firewalls, routers, and switches.
- **System Logs**: Produced by operating systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS, or Chrome OS.
- **Application Logs**: Created by software applications, detailing events within the application.
- **Security Logs**: Generated by security tools like antivirus software and IDS, containing security-related information.
- **Authentication Logs**: Capture data about authentication attempts, such as successful logins.

### Log Details

Logs generally include information such as the date, time, location, action, and author of the action. Verbose logging can provide additional detailed information beyond the default log settings, which can be particularly useful in incident analysis.

## Log Management

Managing logs effectively involves collecting, storing, analyzing, and disposing of log data. Proper log management ensures that the most relevant information is logged, accessed easily, and kept secure.

### What to Log

It is crucial to identify the most useful logs based on the organization's needs. Logging excessive information, especially sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII), should be carefully managed to comply with legal and regulatory standards.

### The Issue with Overlogging

Overlogging, or logging excessive amounts of data, can increase storage costs, degrade system performance, and make it harder to identify important events during an investigation. Organizations should avoid the temptation to log everything and instead focus on relevant data.

### Log Retention

Log retention involves keeping logs for a specified period, often dictated by regulatory requirements. Organizations in sectors like healthcare (HIPAA), financial services (PCI DSS, GLBA, SOX), and the public sector (FISMA) may need to modify their log management policies to comply with these standards.

### Log Protection

Protecting logs is essential to maintain their integrity. Malicious actors may try to alter logs to hide their activities. Storing logs on a centralized log server rather than on local machines creates a barrier that protects against unauthorized access and tampering.
