# Reexamine SIEM Tools

In this session, you revisited the critical role of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools in a security analystâ€™s toolkit. SIEM tools are essential for collecting, analyzing, and reporting on security data from various sources within an organization's environment.

## Key Functions of SIEM Tools

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
   - **Collection**: SIEM tools collect vast amounts of data generated by different devices and systems across an organization's network.
   - **Normalization**: Collected data is normalized, meaning it's converted into a standard format to ensure consistency. This makes the data easier to read, analyze, and search.
   - **Indexing**: Once normalized, the data is indexed, allowing for quick access and searchability within the SIEM tool.
2. **Data Analysis and Reporting**:
   - SIEM tools provide security analysts with the ability to quickly access and analyze data flows across networks.
   - They are critical in triaging alerts, monitoring systems, and analyzing log data during incident investigations.

## Common SIEM Tools

You explored two widely used SIEM tools in the security industry:

1. **Splunk**:

   - A comprehensive data analysis platform that includes SIEM capabilities.

   - Key Features

     :

     - Collects data from multiple sources.
     - Processes and stores the data in an index.
     - Provides search, analysis, and visualization options.

2. **Google Chronicle**:

   - A cloud-based SIEM tool by Google Cloud.

   - Key Features

     :

     - Data is forwarded to Chronicle for storage and analysis.
     - Normalization cleans up data to make it easier to process and index.
