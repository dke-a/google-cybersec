# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

---

## **Introduction to IDS and IPS**
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
  - **Definition:** An application that monitors system and network activity, analyzing for abnormal behaviors or possible intrusions.
  - **Functionality:** Similar to a home security system, IDS sensors detect unusual activity and trigger alerts to notify appropriate personnel or channels.
  - **Purpose:** IDS helps identify potential threats or intrusions by analyzing collected system information.

- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):**
  - **Definition:** An advanced version of IDS that not only detects intrusions but also takes action to prevent them.
  - **Functionality:** Works like a security system that automatically blocks intrusions, such as deploying a steel door when a window is shattered in a jewelry store scenario.
  - **Purpose:** IPS actively mitigates threats by preventing intrusions from compromising the system.

## **Tools for IDS and IPS**
- **Popular IDS/IPS Tools:**
  - **Snort**
  - **Zeek**
  - **Kismet**
  - **Sagan**
  - **Suricata**
  
  These tools are capable of performing both IDS and IPS functions, providing comprehensive security monitoring and prevention.

## **Alert Management**
- **Alert Notifications:**
  - **Destination:** Alerts generated by IDS/IPS tools are sent to security teams for action.
  - **Next Steps:** Alerts are managed using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, which will be discussed in upcoming lessons.

## **Key Takeaways**
- IDS and IPS are essential components of a robust security strategy.
- While IDS detects potential threats, IPS takes proactive steps to prevent them.
- Understanding and using the right tools, like Suricata and Snort, enhances an organization's ability to monitor and secure its networks.
