# Incident Response Tools

---

## **Introduction**
As a security analyst, you'll be on the front lines of detecting and responding to security threats. To perform these tasks effectively, you'll rely on a variety of tools and technologies. Just as a carpenter uses multiple tools to create a piece of furniture, you'll use a range of incident response tools to monitor, detect, analyze, and document security events.

## **Types of Incident Response Tools**

### **1. Detection and Management Tools**
- **Purpose:** These tools monitor system activity and help identify events that may require further investigation.
- **Examples:**
  - **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Monitor network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations.
  - **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Aggregate and analyze activity from many different resources across your IT infrastructure.

### **2. Documentation Tools**
- **Purpose:** Used to collect and compile evidence during an incident investigation.
- **Examples:**
  - **Incident Handler's Journal:** A personal or organizational tool used to document the details of security incidents as they occur.
  - **Case Management Systems:** Help organize and manage documentation for ongoing investigations.

### **3. Investigative Tools**
- **Purpose:** These tools assist in analyzing security events, often by examining network traffic or system data.
- **Examples:**
  - **Packet Sniffers (e.g., Wireshark):** Capture and analyze the data packets that are transmitted over a network.
  - **Log Analysis Tools:** Parse through log files to identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate a security incident.
