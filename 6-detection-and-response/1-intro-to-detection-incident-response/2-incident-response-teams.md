## **Introduction**
Incident response teams are critical in managing and responding to security incidents. These teams consist of both security and non-security professionals who collaborate to address and mitigate the impact of incidents. The effectiveness of incident response hinges on the coordinated efforts of diverse team members working towards a common goal.

## **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
- **Shared Responsibility:** Security is a collective responsibility that requires collaboration across different departments.
- **Legal Involvement:** In the case of breaches involving sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial documents), the legal team must be consulted to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Public Disclosure:** If an incident necessitates public disclosure, CSIRTs must work with the public relations team to coordinate the communication strategy.

## **CSIRT Roles and Functions**

### **Security Analyst**

- **Specialized Focus:** Some teams may focus solely on crisis management, while others may be integrated with a Security Operations Center (SOC).
- **Role Variations:** Roles may have different names (e.g., a technical lead may be called an Ops lead) depending on the organization's structure.
