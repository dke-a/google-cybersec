# Introduction to the Incident Response Lifecycle

## Overview

Incident lifecycle frameworks provide a structured approach to incident response operations. These frameworks help organizations develop a standardized method to manage incidents effectively and consistently. There are various frameworks that organizations can adopt and modify according to their needs.

## Focus on NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

- The NIST CSF consists of five core functions:
  - **Identify**
  - **Protect**
  - **Detect**
  - **Respond**
  - **Recover**

- This course focuses on the last three steps: **Detect, Respond, and Recover**, which are critical during incident response.

## NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

The NIST Incident Response Lifecycle is another framework provided by NIST with additional sub-steps dedicated to incident response:

1. **Preparation**
2. **Detection and Analysis**
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
4. **Post-Incident Activity**

- **Note**: The incident lifecycle is not a linear process; it is a cycle, meaning steps can overlap as new discoveries are made.

## What is an Incident?

According to NIST, an incident is:

- "An occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies."

### Events vs. Security Incidents

- **Event**: An observable occurrence on a network, system, or device.
  - Example: A user requests a password reset after forgetting their password.
- **Security Incident**: An event where security policies are violated.
  - Example: A malicious actor successfully initiates a password reset on someone else's account.

- **Key Point**: All security incidents are events, but not all events are security incidents.

## Incident Investigation

- Security analysts handle and document evidence and findings during an incident investigation, similar to detectives handling a case.
- The investigation reveals critical information about the **Five W's** of an incident:
  - **Who** triggered the incident
  - **What** happened
  - **When** the incident took place
  - **Where** the incident took place
  - **Why** the incident occurred

## Documentation in Incident Response

- **Incident Handlerâ€™s Journal**: A form of documentation used to keep track of incident details. It is essential for easy access and reference during an investigation and when writing the final report.

- **Importance**: Keeping detailed notes during an incident is crucial for both the investigation process and the closure of the investigation.
