# Roles in Incident Response

---

## **Introduction**
In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding the roles within incident response teams is essential. These roles are defined within frameworks like the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Incident Response Lifecycle**, which outlines four key phases:

- **Preparation**
- **Detection and Analysis**
- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
- **Post-Incident Activity**

This guide will explore the different functions, roles, and responsibilities within **Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)** and **Security Operations Centers (SOCs)**, helping you navigate an organization's hierarchy and understand how to work cohesively to respond to incidents.

## **Command, Control, and Communication**

### **CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)**
- **Definition:** A specialized group of security professionals trained in incident management and response.
- **Command:** Ensuring appropriate leadership and direction during incident response.
- **Control:** Managing technical aspects such as resource coordination and task assignment.
- **Communication:** Keeping stakeholders informed throughout the incident response process.

### **Establishing Roles in CSIRTs**
