# Business Continuity Considerations

Business continuity planning is essential for organizations to minimize the impact of security incidents on their normal operations. This planning helps ensure that critical business functions can continue during and after disruptions caused by incidents like ransomware attacks.

## Business Continuity Planning

A **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** is a document that outlines the procedures necessary to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption. It helps organizations maintain critical functions and quickly restore services when incidents occur. BCPs provide a structured approach to responding and recovering from incidents, helping to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational damages.

- **Note**: BCPs differ from disaster recovery plans, which specifically focus on recovering information systems after major disasters like hardware failures or natural disasters.

## Impacts of Ransomware on Business Continuity

Security incidents, such as ransomware attacks, can severely disrupt business operations, especially in critical sectors like healthcare. Ransomware can encrypt data, disabling access to essential systems and services, such as medical records, which can hinder patient care. On a larger scale, disruptions to critical infrastructure can affect national security, economic stability, and public safety. BCPs are essential in ensuring that organizations can continue providing essential services despite such disruptions.

## Recovery Strategies

BCPs include recovery strategies that help organizations resume normal operations after an outage. One common strategy is site resilience, which ensures the availability of critical infrastructure, such as networks and data centers, during disruptions.

### Site Resilience

**Resilience** is the ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions. Organizations can design resilient systems that continue to deliver services even when faced with challenges. Site resilience involves using alternate sites to maintain operations during incidents.

There are three main types of recovery sites:

- **Hot Sites**: Fully operational facilities that are exact duplicates of an organizationâ€™s primary environment. Hot sites can be activated immediately if the primary site fails or is disrupted.

- **Warm Sites**: Facilities that are updated and configured similarly to hot sites but are not fully operational. They can quickly become operational when needed.

- **Cold Sites**: Backup facilities equipped with basic infrastructure. Cold sites require additional setup before they can be used, making them slower to activate compared to hot or warm sites.

## Key Takeaways

Security incidents can significantly disrupt business operations, making business continuity planning essential. BCPs help organizations prepare for and manage the impacts of incidents, ensuring that critical services remain available and that normal operations can resume as quickly as possible.
