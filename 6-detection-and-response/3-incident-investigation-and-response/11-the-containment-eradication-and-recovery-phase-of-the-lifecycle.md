# The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phase of the Lifecycle

The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phase is the third phase of the incident response lifecycle. This phase focuses on managing the incident after detection to minimize damage, eliminate the threat, and restore normal operations. The actions taken in this phase align with the core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Respond and Recover. The three main steps in this phase—Containment, Eradication, and Recovery—are interconnected, with each step supporting the next.

## 1. Containment

**Containment** is the first step in this phase and involves limiting the impact of an incident to prevent further damage. Once an incident has been detected, security teams use containment strategies outlined in the organization's incident response plan. These strategies specify the actions to take based on the type and severity of the incident. Containment can be immediate or long-term, depending on the situation.

- **Example**: A common containment strategy for a malware incident on a single system is to isolate the affected system by disconnecting it from the network. This prevents the malware from spreading to other systems, limiting the damage to just the compromised system.

Containment actions are critical because they set the stage for the next step—eradication.

## 2. Eradication

**Eradication** is the process of completely removing all elements of the threat from the affected systems. This step ensures that all traces of the incident are eliminated to prevent the threat from resurfacing. Eradication activities are tailored to the type of incident and may involve thorough system scans, vulnerability assessments, and the removal of malicious code or software.

- **Example**: Eradication can involve conducting vulnerability tests and applying patches to address any vulnerabilities exploited by the threat. It may also include removing malware, cleaning infected files, and uninstalling unauthorized software.

Eradication is essential for fully neutralizing the threat before moving on to recovery.

## 3. Recovery

**Recovery** is the final step in this phase and focuses on restoring affected systems to normal operations. An incident can disrupt essential business functions, and recovery aims to bring all impacted services and systems back online securely. Recovery actions are critical to resuming normal business activities and minimizing downtime.

- **Example**: Recovery actions include reimaging affected systems to their pre-incident state, resetting compromised passwords, and adjusting security configurations, such as firewall rules, to prevent future incidents.

During recovery, security teams must carefully monitor systems to ensure that the incident does not recur. The goal is to fully restore the organization’s operations while maintaining enhanced security postures.

## Key Takeaways

The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phase is essential in managing incidents effectively. By containing the threat, eradicating it completely, and recovering impacted systems, organizations can minimize damage, maintain operational continuity, and strengthen their security posture. This phase emphasizes the need for a structured and strategic response to incidents, ensuring that organizations are prepared to handle and recover from security events.
