# Post-Incident Review

The Post-incident activity phase of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle involves reviewing an incident to identify areas for improvement during incident handling. This phase provides security analysts and teams an opportunity to learn from incidents and refine their responses to future threats.

## Lessons Learned

After containing, eradicating, and recovering from an incident, security teams conduct a **lessons learned meeting** (or post-mortem) to evaluate the entire incident. This meeting, involving all parties who participated in the response, helps assess actions taken and identify areas for improvement without assigning blame. Meetings are usually scheduled within two weeks after incident remediation and focus on:

- Understanding what happened and when.
- Identifying who discovered the incident.
- Reviewing containment and recovery actions.
- Discussing what could have been done differently.

Lessons learned meetings offer a platform for information sharing and recommend actionable changes to improve future incident response. Recommendations may include updating playbooks, refining procedures, or implementing new security tools.

**Pro Tip:** Meeting organizers should distribute an agenda and assign roles (moderator, scribe) before the meeting to ensure effective discussions.

## Final Report

The **final report** is a critical document created at the end of an incident, providing a comprehensive review. It captures the details of the incident using the 5 W's: who, what, where, why, and when. The format can vary, but common elements include:

- **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview highlighting key findings.
- **Timeline:** A detailed chronological sequence of the incident events.
- **Investigation:** A summary of the detection and analysis actions, such as network artifact analysis.
- **Recommendations:** Suggested actions for preventing future incidents.

**Pro Tip:** Tailor the report to the audience, especially when writing for business executives who may not be familiar with technical details. This ensures effective communication of key findings and recommendations.

## Key Takeaways

Post-incident actions mark the end of the incident response lifecycle, providing opportunities to evaluate response actions, recommend improvements, and create the final report. These activities help strengthen an organizationâ€™s incident handling processes and enhance overall security posture.
