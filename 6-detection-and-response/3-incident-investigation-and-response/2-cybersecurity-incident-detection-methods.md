### Cybersecurity Incident Detection Methods

Detection methods in cybersecurity are essential for identifying and responding to threats effectively. Here's an overview of different detection methods:

1. **Threat Hunting**: 
   - **Proactive Search for Threats**: Threat hunting involves actively searching for hidden threats in a network that automated detection tools may miss. This approach combines human expertise with technology to uncover sophisticated threats like fileless malware.
   - **Role of Threat Hunters**: Threat hunters research emerging threats, understand the tactics of attackers, and use various tools, such as threat intelligence and indicators of compromise (IoCs), to detect potential threats before they cause damage.

2. **Threat Intelligence**: 
   - **Evidence-Based Information**: Threat intelligence provides context about existing or emerging threats. It includes data from various sources such as industry reports, government advisories, and threat data feeds.
   - **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**: TIPs help organizations manage large volumes of threat intelligence by centralizing and analyzing data, making it easier to identify and prioritize relevant threats.

3. **Cyber Deception**:
   - **Deceptive Techniques**: Cyber deception uses methods to deliberately mislead attackers. This can include creating decoy systems or resources, known as honeypots, that are designed to attract and trap malicious actors.
   - **Example of Honeypots**: A honeypot could be a fake file labeled "Client Credit Card Information - 2022," which, when accessed by an attacker, alerts security teams to the intrusion.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Diverse Detection Methods**: Organizations should employ various detection methods to stay ahead of evolving threats.
- **Combination of Tools and Human Expertise**: The most effective detection strategies combine automated tools, human analysis, and deception techniques to improve the overall security posture.
