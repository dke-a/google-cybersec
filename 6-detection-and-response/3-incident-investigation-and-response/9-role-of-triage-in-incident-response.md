# The Role of Triage in Incident Response

Triage is a crucial process in incident response, allowing security analysts to manage and prioritize alerts efficiently, much like how emergency departments prioritize patients based on the urgency of their medical conditions.

## What is Triage?

- **Medical Triage**: In the medical field, triage is used to categorize patients based on the urgency of their conditions. Life-threatening conditions receive immediate attention, while less critical issues may wait.
  
- **Security Triage**: Similarly, in cybersecurity, triage prioritizes incidents according to their severity and potential impact on the organization's systems, particularly in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Importance of Triage in Security

- **Resource Management**: Security teams have limited resources, so they must efficiently allocate their time and attention to incidents that pose the most significant threat.

- **Urgency of Incidents**: Not all incidents require the same level of urgency. For example, ransomware, which can cause severe financial and operational damage, would be prioritized over a phishing email incident.

## The Triage Process

1. **Receive and Assess the Alert**: When an alert is received, it is first assessed to determine if it's a false positive or related to an existing incident.
   
2. **Assign Priority**: If the alert is a true positive, its priority is determined based on the organization's policies and guidelines. The priority level will dictate the response urgency.

3. **Investigate and Analyze**: The alert is then thoroughly investigated, and relevant evidence is collected and analyzed, such as system logs.

## Adding Context to Alerts

- **Thorough Analysis**: Security analysts must add context to their investigations to avoid assumptions and ensure accurate conclusions. For instance, an alert for a failed login attempt might require further questions:
  - Were there multiple failed attempts?
  - Did the login attempt occur outside of normal working hours?
  - Was the attempt made from an unusual location?

By asking these questions, analysts can build a comprehensive picture of the incident and make informed decisions.

## Conclusion

Triage is a fundamental part of the incident response process, enabling security teams to prioritize and manage alerts effectively, ensuring that the most critical incidents receive the attention they require.
