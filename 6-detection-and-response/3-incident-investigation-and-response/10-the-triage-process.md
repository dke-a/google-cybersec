# The Triage Process

Triage is a critical process in incident response that helps security analysts efficiently assess and prioritize security alerts. By understanding the triage process, analysts can effectively address and resolve incidents to minimize their impact on the organization.

## Triage Process Overview

Incidents have the potential to cause significant damage, making it crucial for security teams to respond quickly. The triage process prioritizes incidents based on their urgency, allowing teams to allocate resources to address the most critical issues first. The triage process consists of three main steps:

1. **Receive and Assess**
2. **Assign Priority**
3. **Collect and Analyze**

### 1. Receive and Assess

In the first step, an alert is received from an alerting system, such as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The analyst reviews the alert to verify its validity and gathers as much information as possible, including the nature of the activity that triggered the alert, the involved systems, and more. Key questions to consider during this step:

- **Is the alert a false positive?** Determine whether the alert reflects a genuine threat or an error.
- **Was this alert triggered in the past?** Reviewing the alert history can provide insights into whether the issue is recurring.
- **Is the alert triggered by a known vulnerability?** This can help identify the appropriate response based on existing knowledge.
- **What is the severity of the alert?** Assessing severity helps prioritize the response effectively.

### 2. Assign Priority

Once verified, the alert needs to be prioritized. Incidents vary in impact, size, and scope, which influences the response strategy. Factors to consider include:

- **Functional Impact**: Understand how the incident affects the operation of IT systems and services. For example, ransomware can disrupt system availability and data integrity.
- **Information Impact**: Evaluate the consequences of compromised data, particularly sensitive information that could affect third parties.
- **Recoverability**: Consider whether the organization can recover from the incident and whether it is worth the time and resources to do so.

### 3. Collect and Analyze

In the final step, the analyst performs a comprehensive analysis by gathering evidence, conducting external research, and documenting the findings. The aim is to collect sufficient information to make an informed decision on addressing the incident. Depending on the incident's severity, escalation to a higher-level analyst or manager may be necessary.

## Benefits of Triage

- **Resource Management**: Triage helps security teams allocate resources efficiently, focusing on high-priority threats and reducing response time.
- **Standardized Approach**: Triage creates a standardized process for incident handling, ensuring that only valid alerts are escalated for further investigation.

## Key Takeaways

The triage process is essential for prioritizing security incidents and managing resources effectively. As a security professional, mastering triage will enable you to respond to and resolve incidents efficiently, ensuring that your organization meets its incident response goals.
