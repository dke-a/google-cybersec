### Activity: Investigate a Suspicious File Hash

**Summary**: An activity was completed that involved analyzing a suspicious file hash using VirusTotal and documenting the associated Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) within the Pyramid of Pain framework. The activity required assessing the malicious nature of a file based on VirusTotal's detection report and identifying key IoCs related to the file.

**Steps Taken**:

1. **Accessed VirusTotal**:
   - The provided SHA256 hash was entered to retrieve the analysis report.
2. **Analyzed VirusTotal Report**:
   - Key sections such as Detection, Details, Relations, Behavior, and Community Score were reviewed.
   - Determined whether the file was malicious based on the analysis.
3. **Identified IoCs**:
   - Three key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) were located from the VirusTotal report.
   - These IoCs were documented in the Pyramid of Pain template, categorized into relevant sections such as Hash values, IP addresses, Domain names, etc.

**Artifacts**:

- The **Pyramid of Pain** template was completed with the identified IoCs.
- Detailed analysis notes were created regarding the fileâ€™s malicious nature and IoCs.

**Next Steps**:

- The activity repository should be checked for the saved Pyramid of Pain template and any additional documentation created during this activity.
