# Exemplar: Manage Authorization

## Activity Overview

In this lab activity, youâ€™ll use Linux commands to configure authorization. Authorization is crucial for maintaining system security by ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources.

### Importance of Authorization

Authorization prevents unauthorized users from accessing and modifying files, thus protecting sensitive information and maintaining system integrity.

### Scenario

In this scenario, you must manage permissions on the files in the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory for the `researcher2` user, who is part of the `research_team` group. Your tasks include checking and modifying permissions to align with appropriate access levels.

### Tasks Overview

1. **Check file and directory details**
2. **Change file permissions**
3. **Change file permissions on a hidden file**
4. **Change directory permissions**

## Task 1: Check File and Directory Details

### Navigate to the Projects Directory

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
cd projects
```

### List Contents and Permissions

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
ls -l
```

Example Output:

```
diff
Copy code
total 20
drwx--x--- 2 researcher2 research_team 4096 Oct 14 18:40 drafts
-rw-rw-rw- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Oct 14 18:40 project_k.txt
-rw-r----- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Oct 14 18:40 project_m.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Oct 14 18:40 project_r.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Oct 14 18:40 project_t.txt
```

### Understanding Permissions

- **File Type**: `d` for directory, `-` for regular file.
- **User Permissions**: Characters 2-4 (e.g., `rwx`).
- **Group Permissions**: Characters 5-7 (e.g., `rwx`).
- **Other Permissions**: Characters 8-10 (e.g., `rwx`).

### Check for Hidden Files

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
ls -la
```

### Identifying Hidden Files

Example Output:

```
diff
Copy code
-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 research_team  46 Oct 14 18:40 .project_x.txt
```

## Task 2: Change File Permissions

### Identify Files with Incorrect Permissions

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
ls -l
```

### Example Output Analysis

File `project_k.txt` grants write permissions to others (`-rw-rw-rw-`).

### Remove Write Permissions from Others

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
chmod o-w project_k.txt
```

### Restrict Group Permissions on `project_m.txt`

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
chmod g-r project_m.txt
```

## Task 3: Change File Permissions on a Hidden File

### Check Hidden File Permissions

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
ls -la
```

### Identify Incorrect Write Permissions

Example Output Analysis: File `.project_x.txt` grants write permissions to user and group.

### Adjust Permissions

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt
```

## Task 4: Change Directory Permissions

### Check Permissions of `drafts` Directory

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
ls -l
```

### Example Output Analysis

Directory `drafts` grants execute permissions to the group (`drwx--x---`).

### Remove Execute Permission from Group

Command:

```
bash
Copy code
chmod g-x drafts
```

## Conclusion

In this lab, you have gained practical experience with Linux commands to:

- Examine file and directory permissions.
- Change permissions on files and directories to align with the principle of least privilege.
- Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.
