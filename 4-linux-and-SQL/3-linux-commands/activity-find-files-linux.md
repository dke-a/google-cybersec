## Task 3: Locate and Read the Contents of a File

1. Navigate to the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory

   :

   - Command: `cd /home/analyst/reports/users`

2. List the files in the current directory

   :

   - Command: `ls`
   - Output Example: `Q1_added_users.txt`

3. Display the contents of the `Q1_added_users.txt` file

   :

   - Command: `cat Q1_added_users.txt`

   - Example Content:

     ```bash
     username  department          employee_id
     aezra     Human Resources     1104
     mreed     Information Technology 1177
     ```

### Questions:

    - 1104
    - 1188
    - 1001

## Task 4: Navigate to a Directory and Locate a File

1. Navigate to the `/home/analyst/logs` directory

   :

   - Command: `cd /home/analyst/logs`

2. Display the name of the file it contains

   :

   - Command: `ls`
   - Output Example: `server_logs.txt`

3. Display the first 10 lines of the `server_logs.txt` file

   :

   - Command: `head server_logs.txt`

   - Example Content:

     ```bash
     [WARNING] 2023-06-01 Connection lost

- Number of warning messages in the first 10 lines of the `server_logs.txt` file

  :

  - Options:
    - Three
    - One
    - Six
    - Two

## Conclusion

In this activity, you have practiced:

- Navigating directory structures with the `cd` command.
- Displaying the current working directory with the `pwd` command.
- Listing the contents of a directory with the `ls` command.
- Displaying the contents of files with the `cat` and `head` commands.

These are fundamental skills for security analysts working with Linux systems.
