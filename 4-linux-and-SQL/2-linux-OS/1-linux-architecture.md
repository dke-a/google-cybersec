# Linux Architecture

## Introduction
Operating systems, like buildings, have an architecture made up of discrete components that work together to form the whole. Linux architecture includes the user, applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, the kernel, and the hardware.

## Components of Linux Architecture

### User
- **User**: The person interacting with the computer. In Linux, the user initiates tasks or commands that the OS executes.
- **Multi-user System**: Linux allows more than one user to use the system's resources simultaneously.

### Applications
- **Applications**: Programs that perform specific tasks (e.g., word processors, calculators).
  - **Example**: Nano, a text editor, is a popular Linux application.
- **Distribution**: Linux applications are commonly distributed through package managers.

### Shell
- **Shell**: A command-line interpreter (CLI) that processes commands and outputs results.
  - **Communication**: The shell is how users communicate with the system.

### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
- **FHS**: Organizes data in the Linux OS, similar to a filing cabinet.
  - **Function**: It stores data in a way that can be accessed and found by the system.

### Kernel
- **Kernel**: Manages processes and memory, and communicates with hardware to execute commands sent by the shell.
  - **Drivers**: The kernel uses drivers to enable applications to execute tasks.
  - **Resource Management**: Ensures efficient allocation of system resources, enhancing system performance.

### Hardware
- **Hardware**: The physical components of a computer (e.g., CPU, mouse, keyboard).
  - **Comparison**: Unlike software applications, which can be downloaded, hardware refers to tangible components.

## Summary
Understanding these components of Linux architecture will help in becoming familiar with Linux. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and efficiency of the operating system.
