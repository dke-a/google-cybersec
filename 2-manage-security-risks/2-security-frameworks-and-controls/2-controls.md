## Controls

### Introduction
- Frameworks create plans for addressing security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Controls are used to reduce specific risks and prevent significant financial and reputational damage.

### Definition of Controls
- **Security Controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

### Common Types of Controls

#### 1. Encryption
- **Definition:** Converting data from a readable format (plaintext) to an encoded format (ciphertext).
- **Purpose:** Ensures confidentiality of sensitive data (e.g., customers' account information, social security numbers).
- **Process:** Data is unreadable in ciphertext form and can only be read when decrypted back to plaintext.



#### . Authentication

- **Definition:** Verifying the identity of someone or something.
- **Examples:**
  - Logging into a website with a username and password.
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires a password and an additional form of authentication (e.g., security code, biometrics).
- **Biometrics:** Unique physical characteristics used for verification (e.g., fingerprint, eye scan, palm scan).
  - **Vishing:** Exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source.

#### 3. Authorization
- **Definition:** Granting access to specific resources within a system.
- **Purpose:** Verifies that a person has permission to access a resource.
- **Example:** Federal government employees accessing internal data or deep web resources.
