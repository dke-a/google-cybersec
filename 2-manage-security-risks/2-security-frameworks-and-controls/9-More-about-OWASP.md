## More about OWASP Security Principles

### Introduction
Cybersecurity analysts help keep data safe and reduce risk for an organization by using a variety of security frameworks, controls, and security principles. The Open Web Application Security Project, recently renamed Open Worldwide Application Security Project® (OWASP), provides several security principles that are crucial for maintaining security in the workplace.

### Previously Introduced OWASP Security Principles

#### 1. Minimize Attack Surface Area
- **Definition:** Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.
- **Implementation:** Disable unnecessary software features, restrict access, and enforce complex password requirements.

#### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- **Definition:** Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.
- **Implementation:** Limit user permissions to only what is necessary for their roles.

#### 3. Defense in Depth
- **Definition:** Organizations should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways.
- **Implementation:** Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and strict permission settings.

#### 4. Separation of Duties
- **Definition:** Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege.
- **Implementation:** Ensure no single person has too much control, for example, separating payroll preparation and signing.

#### 5. Keep Security Simple
- **Definition:** Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.
- **Implementation:** Implement straightforward, manageable security controls that are easy to understand and use.

#### 6. Fix Security Issues Correctly
- **Definition:** When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.
- **Implementation:** Establish thorough incident response procedures and perform regular testing of fixes.

### Additional OWASP Security Principles

#### 7. Establish Secure Defaults
- **Definition:** The optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure.
- **Implementation:** Ensure that security settings are configured to their highest levels by default.

#### 8. Fail Securely
- **Definition:** When a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option.
- **Implementation:** Configure systems, like firewalls, to block all connections if they fail.

#### 9. Don’t Trust Services
- **Definition:** Organizations should not explicitly trust that third-party partners' systems are secure.
- **Implementation:** Verify and validate data from third-party services before sharing it with customers or using it internally.

#### 10. Avoid Security by Obscurity
- **Definition:** The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden.
- **Implementation:** Focus on robust security measures like strong password policies, solid network architecture, and comprehensive fraud and audit controls rather than hiding the source code or system details.

### Key Takeaways
Cybersecurity professionals constantly apply security principles to safeguard organizations and the people they serve. As an entry-level security analyst, you can use these security principles to promote safe development practices that reduce risks to companies and users alike.

### Examples of Implementation
- **Minimize Attack Surface Area:** Disable unused ports and services, restrict user access to essential systems only.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only have access to the information they need.
- **Defense in Depth:** Combine firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits.
- **Separation of Duties:** Separate responsibilities among different employees to prevent fraud and errors.
- **Keep Security Simple:** Use clear, understandable security protocols that all employees can follow.
- **Fix Security Issues Correctly:** Use comprehensive incident response plans to address security breaches thoroughly.
- **Establish Secure Defaults:** Set all system defaults to the most secure settings, such as enabling encryption by default.
- **Fail Securely:** Ensure systems like firewalls default to blocking all traffic if they fail.
- **Don’t Trust Services:** Independently verify the security of third-party services and data.
- **Avoid Security by Obscurity:** Employ multiple layers of security rather than relying on hidden system details for protection.
