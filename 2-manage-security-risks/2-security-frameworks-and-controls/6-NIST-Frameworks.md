## NIST Frameworks

### Introduction
- **Purpose of Frameworks:** Frameworks are used as a starting point to develop plans that mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to sensitive data and assets.
- **Global Usage:** Organizations worldwide create frameworks to help security professionals develop effective plans.

### National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Frameworks
- **Scope:** NIST frameworks support ongoing security efforts for various organizations, including for-profit, non-profit, and government agencies.
- **Global Influence:** Although NIST is US-based, its guidance is valuable to analysts globally.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- **Nature:** A voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
- **Core Functions:** 
  1. Identify
  2. Protect
  3. Detect
  4. Respond
  5. Recover
- **Application Example:**
  - **Incident:** High-risk notification of a compromised workstation with an unknown device.
  - **Steps Taken:**
    1. Identify the compromised workstation.
    2. Block the unknown device remotely.
    3. Remove the infected workstation.
    4. Use tools to detect additional threats.
    5. Investigate the incident (who, how, what, where).
    6. Recover affected files or data and correct damage.

### NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53
- **Purpose:** Provides a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the US federal government.
- **Application:** Used to maintain the CIA triad for government systems, including those provided by private companies for federal use.

### Importance and Integration
- **Frameworks and Controls:** Work together to develop plans to handle incidents, lower risk, protect organizations, and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **NIST CSF:** Widely respected and essential for maintaining security.
- **NIST SP 800-53:** Crucial for those interested in working with or for the US federal government.

### Key Takeaways
- **Core Functions:** Understanding and applying the five core functions of the NIST CSF.
- **Framework Integration:** Recognizing how frameworks like NIST CSF and SP 800-53 work together to enhance security.
