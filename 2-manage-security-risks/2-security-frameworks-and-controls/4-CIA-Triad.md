## Explore the CIA Triad

### Introduction
- The CIA triad is a core security model essential for protecting an organization's sensitive assets and data from threat actors.
- The three components of the CIA triad are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

### The CIA Triad Components

#### 1. Confidentiality
- **Definition:** Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
- **Importance:** Sensitive data should be available on a "need to know" basis to ensure that only those authorized to handle certain assets or data have access.
- **Example:** Banks keeping people's personal and financial information safe.

#### 2. Integrity
- **Definition:** The data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
- **Importance:** Ensuring data integrity helps security professionals determine whether the data can be trusted.
- **Example:** Banks disabling access to accounts if spending habits change dramatically to verify the account owner's identity.

#### 3. Availability
- **Definition:** The data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
- **Importance:** Inaccessible data isn't useful and can prevent people from performing their jobs. Ensuring systems, networks, and applications function properly to allow timely and reliable access.
- **Example:** Banks ensuring easy access to account information on the web while using validation processes to protect customer accounts from threat actors.

### Application of the CIA Triad
- Security analysts regularly use each component of the triad to protect their organization and the people it serves.
- The CIA triad helps keep sensitive data and assets safe from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, including social engineering attacks, malware, and data theft.

### Conclusion
- Understanding and applying the CIA triad is crucial for entry-level security analysts.
- Keeping the CIA triad in mind helps maintain a strong security posture within an organization.
