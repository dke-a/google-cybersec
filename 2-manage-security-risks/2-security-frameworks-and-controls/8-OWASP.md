## OWASP Security Principles

### Introduction
- **Purpose:** Protect an organization's data and assets.
- **Tools:** Use OWASP principles alongside NIST frameworks and the CIA triad.

### What is OWASP?
- **Definition:** The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of chapters worldwide, and tens of thousands of members. OWASP provides resources, tools, and guidelines to help organizations secure their web applications.

### OWASP Security Principles

#### 1. Minimize the Attack Surface Area
- **Definition:** Reduce potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.
- **Examples:**
  - **Phishing emails:** Sending fraudulent messages that appear to come from a reputable source to steal sensitive data.
  - **Weak passwords:** Easy-to-guess passwords that can be cracked by attackers.
- **Strategies:**
  - Disable unnecessary software features to limit potential entry points.
  - Restrict access to sensitive assets to only those who need it.
  - Establish and enforce complex password requirements to enhance security.

#### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- **Definition:** Ensure users have the minimum access needed for their tasks.
- **Purpose:** Limit the damage a security breach can cause.
- **Example:**
  - An entry-level analyst may access log data but not change user permissions. This means that if their credentials are compromised, the threat actor would only gain limited access and be unable to make critical changes or access sensitive data.
  - In a hospital, a nurse may access patient treatment records but not the hospital's financial data.

#### 3. Defense in Depth
- **Definition:** Implement multiple security controls addressing risks in different ways.
- **Examples of Controls:**
  - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
  - **Firewalls:** Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
  - **Intrusion detection systems (IDS):** Detect unauthorized access or anomalies in network traffic.
  - **Permission settings:** Define user permissions to restrict access to sensitive areas.
- **Purpose:** Create multiple defense points a threat actor must breach, making it harder for them to succeed.

#### 4. Separation of Duties
- **Definition:** Prevent individuals from having too many privileges that allow misuse.
- **Example:**
  - In a company, the person responsible for authorizing payments should not also handle the accounting records to prevent embezzlement.
  - In IT, the developer who writes the code should not be the same person who deploys it to production to avoid introducing unauthorized changes.
- **Purpose:** Reduce the risk of fraudulent or illegal activities by dividing responsibilities.

#### 5. Keep Security Simple
- **Definition:** Avoid unnecessarily complex security solutions.
- **Purpose:** Ensure manageability and facilitate collaboration.
- **Challenge:** Complex controls can hinder teamwork and efficiency.
- **Example:**
  - Use straightforward encryption methods and clear, concise security policies that all employees can understand and follow.

#### 6. Fix Security Issues Correctly
- **Definition:** Identify and address the root cause of security issues.
- **Example:**
  - If an organization's wifi is compromised due to weak passwords, the solution would involve implementing and enforcing stricter password policies, educating users on creating strong passwords, and possibly upgrading to more secure authentication methods.
- **Steps:**
  - Identify vulnerabilities.
  - Conduct tests to ensure successful repairs.
  - Implement long-term solutions to prevent recurrence.

### Conclusion
- **Benefit:** Understanding these principles enhances your security knowledge.
- **Goal:** Helps you stand out as a security professional.
