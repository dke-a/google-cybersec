## The Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

### Introduction
- Organizations use security frameworks and controls to protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Frameworks and controls work together to mitigate organizational risk.

### Frameworks and Controls

#### Security Frameworks
- **Definition:** Guidelines used for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- **Purpose:** Support organizations in adhering to compliance laws and regulations.
- **Example:** 
  - **HIPAA:** Healthcare industry framework requiring medical professionals to keep patient information safe.

#### Security Controls
- **Definition:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- **Purpose:** Lower risk and threats to data and privacy.
- **Example:**
  - **MFA:** Control requiring patients to use multi-factor authentication to access medical records, ensuring HIPAA compliance.

### Specific Frameworks and Controls

#### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
- **Description:** Developed by the U.S. government to provide a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.
- **Purpose:** Helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information efficiently, improving response to evolving threats.

#### International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
- **Description:** An internationally recognized framework used to manage the security of assets like financial information, intellectual property, and employee data.
- **Purpose:** Outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls to manage risks.
- **Note:** Provides a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture.

### Types of Controls

#### Physical Controls
- **Examples:**
  - Gates, fences, and locks
  - Security guards
  - Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
  - Access cards or badges for office spaces

#### Technical Controls
- **Examples:**
  - Firewalls
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  - Antivirus software

#### Administrative Controls
- **Examples:**
  - Separation of duties
  - Authorization
  - Asset classification

### Key Takeaways
- **Integration:** Frameworks and controls work together to establish an organizationâ€™s security posture.
- **Compliance:** Support organizations in meeting security goals and complying with laws and regulations.
- **Voluntary Implementation:** Although typically voluntary, organizations are strongly encouraged to implement these frameworks and controls to ensure the safety of critical assets.
