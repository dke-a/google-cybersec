# Phases of an Incident Response Playbook

Previously, we discussed how SIEM tools are used to help protect an organization's critical assets and data. In this reading, we'll introduce another important tool for maintaining an organization's security, known as a playbook.

## Playbooks in Cybersecurity

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Playbooks also clarify what tools should be used in response to a security incident. In the security field, playbooks are essential.

- **Purpose**: Ensures people follow a consistent list of actions in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case.
- **Types**: Playbooks for incident response, security alerts, team-specific, and product-specific purposes.

### Incident Response Playbook

An incident response playbook is a guide with six phases used to help mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end.

## The Six Phases of an Incident Response Playbook

### 1. Preparation

- **Objective**: Prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk, and impact of a security incident.
- **Actions**: Documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users.
- **Example**: Creating incident response plans and procedures that outline the roles and responsibilities of each security team member.

### 2. Detection and Analysis

- **Objective**: Detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology.
- **Actions**: Utilize appropriate tools and strategies to determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude.

### 3. Containment

- **Objective**: Prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident.
- **Actions**: Security professionals take actions to contain an incident and minimize damage.
- **Importance**: Helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data.

### 4. Eradication and Recovery

- **Objective**: Complete removal of an incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operations.
- **Actions**: Eliminate artifacts of the incident by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities. Restore the affected environment to a secure state.
- **Also Known As**: IT restoration.

### 5. Post-Incident Activity

- **Objective**: Document the incident, inform organizational leadership, and apply lessons learned.
- **Actions**: Conduct a full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and implement updates or improvements to enhance overall security posture.

### 6. Coordination

- **Objective**: Report incidents and share information throughout the incident response process based on the organization's established standards.
- **Importance**: Ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements and allows for coordinated response and resolution.

## Integration of SIEM Tools and Playbooks

- **SIEM Tools**: Collect and analyze data to detect threats and generate alerts.
- **Usage**: When a security analyst receives a SIEM alert, they use the appropriate playbook to guide the response process.
- **Benefit**: Provides a structured and efficient way of responding to potential security incidents.

## Key Takeaways

Playbooks are essential in cybersecurity for maintaining urgency, efficiency, and accuracy in response to security incidents. By following the structured phases of an incident response playbook, organizations can effectively mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end.
