# SIEM Dashboards

## Overview
- SIEM tools are used to collect and analyze log data.
- SIEM dashboards help security analysts quickly and easily access security information.
- Dashboards present data in charts, graphs, or tables, similar to how weather apps display weather data.

## Purpose of SIEM Dashboards
- **Comprehensive Data Summary:** SIEM dashboards provide a comprehensive summary of security-related data.
- **Metrics for Stakeholders:** They offer different metrics to stakeholders, which are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate.
- **Customization:** Dashboards can be customized to display specific metrics or data relevant to different members of an organization.

## Example of SIEM Dashboard Use
- **Suspicious Login Alert:** A security analyst receives an alert about a suspicious login attempt.
  - **Data Analysis:** The analyst uses the SIEM dashboard to discover:
    - 500 login attempts for Ymara's account in five minutes.
    - Login attempts from geographic locations outside Ymara's usual location and working hours.
  - **Outcome:** The dashboard helps the analyst quickly review visual representations of the timeline, location, and exact time of the activity to determine the suspicious nature of the activity.

## Benefits of SIEM Dashboards
- **Increased Efficiency:** By indexing and minimizing the number of logs a security professional must manually review and analyze, SIEM tools increase efficiency and save time.
- **Real-time Visibility:** Provides real-time visibility, event monitoring and analysis, and automated alerts.
- **Centralized Log Data:** Stores all log data in a centralized location, making it easier to manage and analyze.

### Examples of Customization
- **Monitoring Business Operations:** A security analyst might create a dashboard to monitor everyday business operations, such as the volume of incoming and outgoing network traffic.
