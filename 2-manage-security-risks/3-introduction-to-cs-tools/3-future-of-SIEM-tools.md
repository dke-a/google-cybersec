# The Future of SIEM Tools

## Overview
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools are essential for monitoring and analyzing log data to identify potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- SIEM tools provide real-time monitoring and tracking of security event logs, with various dashboard options to manage and monitor organizational data.

## Current SIEM Solutions
- SIEM tools collect and analyze log data to monitor critical activities.
- They offer real-time visibility, event monitoring and analysis, and automated alerts.
- Currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for the analysis of security events.

## The Future of SIEM Tools

### Cloud Functionality
- **Cloud-hosted SIEM Tools:**
  - Operated by vendors responsible for maintaining and managing the required infrastructure.
  - Accessed through the internet, suitable for organizations not wanting to maintain their own infrastructure.

- **Cloud-native SIEM Tools:**
  - Designed to fully utilize cloud computing capabilities such as availability, flexibility, and scalability.
  - Also maintained and managed by vendors and accessed through the internet.

### Evolving Technologies and Threats
- **Internet of Things (IoT):**
  - The increasing number of interconnected devices enlarges the cybersecurity attack surface.
  - Greater diversity of attacks and data that need special attention.

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):**
  - Enhance SIEM capabilities in identifying threat-related terminology, dashboard visualization, and data storage functionality.

### Automation and SOAR
- **Automation:**
  - Helps security teams respond faster to incidents.
  - Reduces the need for manual intervention by automating common security-related tasks.

- **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):**
  - A collection of applications, tools, and workflows that use automation to respond to security events.
  - Streamlines the process of handling common security incidents, allowing security analysts to focus on more complex issues.

### Integration and Communication
- **Interconnected Systems:**
  - Expectation for cybersecurity-related platforms to communicate and interact with each other.
  - Technology allowing interconnected systems and devices to communicate exists but is still developing.
