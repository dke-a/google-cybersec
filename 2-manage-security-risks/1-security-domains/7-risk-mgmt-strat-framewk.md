**Risk Management Strategies and Frameworks:**

1. **Acceptance:** Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity.
2. **Avoidance:** Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether.
3. **Transference:** Transferring risk to a third party to manage.
4. **Mitigation:** Lessening the impact of a known risk.

**Common Types of Threats:**

- **Insider Threats:** Authorized individuals abusing access to harm the organization.

- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Threat actors maintain unauthorized access over an extended period.

- **External Risk:** Threats from outside the organization attempting to gain access.

- **Internal Risk:** Current or former employees, vendors, or partners posing a security risk.

- **Legacy Systems:** Old systems that can still impact assets.

- **Multiparty Risk:** Risks associated with outsourcing to third-party vendors.

- **Software Compliance/Licensing:** Risks related to outdated or non-compliant software.
