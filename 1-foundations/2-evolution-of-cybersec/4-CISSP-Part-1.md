# Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains, Part 1



## Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

Security and risk management focuses on:
- Defining security goals and objectives
- Risk mitigation
- Compliance
- Business continuity
- Legal aspects

### Example:
Security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

## Domain 2: Asset Security

Asset security focuses on:
- Securing digital and physical assets
- Storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

### Example:
Security analysts may be tasked with ensuring that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information.

## Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering

Security architecture and engineering focuses on:
- Optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place

### Example:
As a security analyst, you may be tasked with configuring a firewall. A firewall is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Proper firewall configuration helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity.

## Domain 4: Communication and Network Security

Communication and network security focuses on:
- Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications

### Example:
As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization. For instance, discovering that users are connecting to unsecured wireless hotspots could leave the organization and its employees vulnerable to attacks. To ensure communications are secure, you would create a network policy to prevent and mitigate exposure.

## Conclusion

Maintaining an organization's security is a team effort, involving many moving parts. As an entry-level analyst, you will continue to develop your skills by learning how to mitigate risks to keep people and data safe. While you don't need to be an expert in all domains, having a basic understanding of them will aid you in your journey as a security professional.
