## Understanding Types of Attacks and Their Associated Risks

### Password Attack
**Definition:** A password attack attempts to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data.

**Common Forms:**
- **Brute Force:** Attempting all possible password combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Rainbow Table:** Using precomputed tables of hashed passwords to reverse cryptographic hash functions and reveal passwords.

**Associated CISSP Domain:** Communication and Network Security.

### Social Engineering Attack
**Definition:** A manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

**Common Forms:**
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent emails to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information.
- **Smishing:** Phishing via SMS messages.
- **Vishing:** Voice phishing, using phone calls.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing at specific individuals or groups.
- **Whaling:** Phishing targeting high-profile executives.
- **Social Media Phishing:** Using social media to gather information and initiate attacks.
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Emails from seemingly known sources requesting sensitive information or financial transactions.
- **Watering Hole Attack:** Compromising a website frequently visited by a target group.
- **USB Baiting:** Leaving malicious USB devices in public places.
- **Physical Social Engineering:** Impersonating an employee, customer, or vendor to gain physical access.

**Associated CISSP Domain:** Security and Risk Management.

### Physical Attack
**Definition:** A security incident that affects both digital and physical environments.

**Common Forms:**
- **Malicious USB Cable:** USB cables that can inject malware.
- **Malicious Flash Drive:** USB drives with malware.
- **Card Cloning and Skimming:** Duplicating credit or debit cards to steal information.

**Associated CISSP Domain:** Asset Security.

### Adversarial Artificial Intelligence
**Definition:** Manipulating AI and machine learning technologies to conduct attacks more efficiently.

**Associated CISSP Domains:** Communication and Network Security, Identity and Access Management.

### Supply-Chain Attack
**Definition:** Targeting systems, applications, hardware, and software in the supply chain to deploy malware.

**Associated CISSP Domains:** Security and Risk Management, Security Architecture and Engineering, Security Operations.

### Cryptographic Attack
**Definition:** Attacks that affect secure communications between a sender and intended recipient.

**Common Forms:**
- **Birthday Attack:** Finding two different inputs that produce the same hash value.
- **Collision Attack:** Two different inputs producing the same hash output, compromising data integrity.
- **Downgrade Attack:** Forcing systems to use less secure protocols.

**Associated CISSP Domain:** Communication and Network Security.

### Key Takeaways
The eight CISSP security domains provide a framework for understanding and mitigating various types of cyber attacks. Familiarity with these domains helps organizations prepare for and fortify against potential data breaches. Understanding these attacks and their risks is crucial for effective security management.
