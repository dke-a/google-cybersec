# Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains, Part 2



## Domain 5: Identity and Access Management

Identity and access management focuses on:
- Keeping data secure by ensuring users follow established policies
- Controlling and managing physical assets (e.g., office spaces) and logical assets (e.g., networks and applications)
- Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles

### Example:
As a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings.

## Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing

Security assessment and testing focuses on:
- Conducting security control testing
- Collecting and analyzing data
- Conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

### Example:
Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions to ensure that users have the correct level of access. For instance, access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries.

## Domain 7: Security Operations

Security operations focuses on:
- Conducting investigations
- Implementing preventative measures

### Example:
As a security analyst, if you receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network, you would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.

## Domain 8: Software Development Security

Software development security focuses on:
- Using secure coding practices
- Creating secure applications and services

### Example:
A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development life-cycle. For instance, if a partner team is creating a new mobile app, you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed.

## Conclusion

That concludes our introduction to CISSP's eight security domains. Challenge yourself to better understand each of these domains and how they affect the overall security of an organization. While they may still be a bit unclear to you this early in the program, these domains will be discussed in greater detail in the next course. See you there!
