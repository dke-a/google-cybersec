# Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness

## Phishing

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. Common types of phishing attacks include:

### Types of Phishing Attacks

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: A threat actor sends an email that appears to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, often for financial gain.
- **Spear Phishing**: A targeted malicious email attack aimed at a specific user or group of users, seemingly originating from a trusted source.
- **Whaling**: A form of spear phishing where threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing**: The use of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source.
- **Smishing**: The use of text messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information or impersonating a known source.

## Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money or, in some cases, an intelligence advantage. Common types of malware attacks include:

### Types of Malware Attacks

- **Viruses**: Malicious code that interferes with computer operations and causes damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user, who transmits it via a malicious attachment or file download. It hides in other files in the infected system and damages or destroys data.
- **Worms**: Malware that can replicate and spread across systems on its own, without needing to be downloaded by a user. It self-replicates from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- **Ransomware**: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware**: Malware used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can access devices to collect personal data, such as emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error often results from trusting someone without question. Threat actors, acting as social engineers, create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit people.

### Types of Social Engineering Attacks

- **Social Media Phishing**: Threat actors collect detailed information about their target from social media sites and then initiate an attack.
- **Watering Hole Attack**: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB Baiting**: A threat actor leaves a malware-infected USB stick for an employee to find and install, unknowingly infecting the network.
- **Physical Social Engineering**: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to gain unauthorized access to a physical location.

### Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering is incredibly effective due to people's natural tendency to trust and respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Sharing personal data, such as location or photos, can be convenient but also poses a risk.

#### Reasons Why Social Engineering Attacks Are Effective

- **Authority**: Impersonating individuals with power because people are conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.
- **Intimidation**: Using bullying tactics to persuade and intimidate victims into compliance.
- **Consensus/Social Proof**: Exploiting people's tendency to do what they believe others are doing by pretending to have prior access granted by other employees.
- **Scarcity**: Implying that goods or services are in limited supply.
- **Familiarity**: Establishing a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
- **Trust**: Developing an emotional relationship with users over time to gain personal information.
- **Urgency**: Persuading others to respond quickly without questioning.
