## Ethics in Cybersecurity

In security, new technologies present new challenges. For every new security incident or risk, the right or wrong decision isn't always clear.

For example, imagine that you're working as an entry-level security analyst and you have received a high-risk alert. You investigate the alert and discover data has been transferred without authorization.

You work diligently to identify who made the transfer and discover it is one of your friends from work. Ethically, as a security professional, your job is to remain unbiased and maintain security and confidentiality.

While it's normal to want to protect a friend, regardless of who the user in question may be, your responsibility and obligation are to adhere to the policies and protocols you've been trained to follow. Security teams are often entrusted with greater access to data and information than other employees, and security professionals must respect that privilege and act ethically at all times.

Security ethics are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional. For example, if you as an analyst have the ability to grant yourself access to payroll data and can give yourself a raise, just because you have access to do so, does that mean you should? The answer is no. You should never abuse the access you've been granted and entrusted with.

## Ethical Principles in Cybersecurity

### 1. Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a crucial ethical principle in cybersecurity. As a security professional, you'll encounter proprietary or private information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It's your ethical duty to keep that information confidential and safe. Violating confidentiality can result in serious consequences, including reprimands, loss of professional reputation, and legal repercussions.

### 2. Privacy Protections

Privacy protection involves safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. Security analysts must follow the policies and procedures of their organizations regarding the handling of personal information. Accessing and sharing personal information without proper authorization is unethical and can lead to severe consequences.

### 3. Laws

Laws are essential ethical considerations in cybersecurity. Violating laws related to data protection and privacy can have severe legal consequences. Security professionals must adhere to relevant laws and regulations to ensure ethical conduct in their work.

As you enter the security field, remember that technology is constantly evolving, and so are attackers' tactics and techniques. Security professionals must continue to think critically about how to respond to attacks and ensure that the proper processes and procedures are followed to mitigate risks.
