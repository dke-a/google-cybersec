# Ethics in Cybersecurity

## Introduction to Security Ethics

### Overview
Security ethics are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional. Being ethical requires that security professionals remain unbiased and maintain the security and confidentiality of private data. A strong sense of ethics helps navigate decisions to mitigate threats from constantly evolving tactics and techniques of threat actors.

### Ethical Concerns and Laws Related to Counterattacks
