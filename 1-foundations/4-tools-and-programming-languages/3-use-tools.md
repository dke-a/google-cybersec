# Use Tools to Protect Business Operations

## Introduction

Previously, you were introduced to programming, operating systems, and tools commonly used by cybersecurity professionals. In this reading, youâ€™ll learn more about programming and operating systems, as well as other tools that entry-level analysts use to help protect organizations and the people they serve.

## Tools and Their Purposes

### Programming

- Programming Languages:
  - **Python:** Used for automation, reducing manual effort and human error.
  - **Structured Query Language (SQL):** Used to create, interact with, and request information from databases.
- **Automation:** Helps execute repetitive tasks efficiently and reduces human error.

### Operating Systems

- **Definition:** An interface between computer hardware and the user.
- Types:
  - **Linux:** Open-source operating system with a command-line interface.
  - **macOS:** Operating system for Apple computers.
  - **Windows:** Operating system for PCs.

### Web Vulnerability

- **Definition:** A flaw in a web application that can be exploited by threat actors.
- **Resource:** Review the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 for the most critical risks to web applications.

### Antivirus Software

- **Definition:** Software used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses.
- **Function:** Scans device memory for patterns indicating the presence of malware.

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

- **Definition:** An application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.
- **Function:** Scans and analyzes network packets to identify potential threats and unauthorized access.

### Encryption

- **Definition:** Makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for unauthorized users.
- **Process:** Converts plaintext (unencrypted information) into secure ciphertext (encrypted information).
- **Note:** Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding allows different systems to share information using a public conversion algorithm.

### Penetration Testing

- **Definition:** Simulated attack to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.
- **Function:** Provides a thorough risk assessment to evaluate and identify threats and weaknesses.

## Key Takeaways

In this reading, you learned more about programming and operating systems. You were also introduced to several new tools and processes. Every organization selects its own set of tools. Therefore, the more tools you know, the more valuable you are to an organization. Tools help security analysts complete their tasks more efficiently and effectively.
