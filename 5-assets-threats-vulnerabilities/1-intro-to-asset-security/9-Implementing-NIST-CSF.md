# Security Guidelines in Action: Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Introduction
Organizations often face an overwhelming amount of risk. Developing a security plan from the beginning that addresses all risks can be challenging. This makes security frameworks, like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a useful option.

## Origins of the Framework
- **Release**: Originally released in 2014.
- **Purpose**: Developed to protect critical infrastructure in the United States.
- **Developer**: NIST was chosen for their unbiased scientific data and practices.
- **Adaptation**: Modified to fit the needs of businesses in both public and private sectors, making it flexible for small businesses.

## Components of the CSF
The CSF consists of three main components: the core, tiers, and profiles.

### Core
- **Description**: A set of desired cybersecurity outcomes.
- **Functions**:
  - **Identify**: Understand the environment to manage cybersecurity risks.
  - **Protect**: Safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.
  - **Detect**: Identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - **Respond**: Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.
  - **Recover**: Plans for resilience and restoration of capabilities or services.

### Tiers
- **Purpose**: Measure the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program.
- **Scale**: Ranges from Level-1 (limited security controls) to Level-4 (exemplary standards).
- **Usage**: Assess security posture and identify areas for improvement.

### Profiles
- **Purpose**: Provide insight into the current state of a security plan.
- **Function**: Tailored templates addressing specific risks of an organization or industry.
- **Usage**: Develop a baseline for cybersecurity plans or compare current posture to industry standards.

## Implementing the CSF
- **Compliance**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
- **Voluntary Framework**: Consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
- **Implementation Steps** (as recommended by CISA):
  1. **Create a Current Profile**: Outline specific needs of your business.
  2. **Perform a Risk Assessment**: Identify which operations meet business and regulatory standards.
  3. **Analyze and Prioritize Gaps**: Identify security operation gaps that put assets at risk.
  4. **Implement a Plan of Action**: Achieve your organization’s goals and objectives.
  - **Pro Tip**: Always consider current risk, threat, and vulnerability trends when using the NIST CSF.

## Industries Embracing the CSF
- **Evolution**: The framework has evolved since its introduction in 2014.
- **Global Influence**: Aligns with security practices across the global economy.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps businesses meet compliance requirements shared by business partners.

## Key Takeaways
- **Flexibility**: The NIST CSF is a flexible resource for assessing and improving security posture.
- **Best Practices**: Combines security best practices from industries worldwide.
- **Challenges**: Implementing the CSF can be challenging but is beneficial for meeting regulatory compliance and avoiding financial and reputational risks.
