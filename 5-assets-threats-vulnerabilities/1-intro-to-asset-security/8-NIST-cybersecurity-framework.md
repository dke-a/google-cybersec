# The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Introduction
- **Security Plan**: Having a plan is essential for securing assets, but ensuring compliance with the plan is equally important.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations to maintain trust, reputation, safety, and data integrity.

## Importance of Compliance
- **High Priority**: Compliance is crucial for businesses, especially in highly regulated industries like healthcare, energy, and finance.
- **Consequences of Non-compliance**: Fines, penalties, and lawsuits can have long-lasting financial and reputational effects.

## Regulations
- **Definition**: Rules set by a government or authority to control how things are done.
- **Purpose**: Protect people and their information on a larger scale.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**: Provides frameworks and security standards reflecting key security-related regulations.
- **Voluntary Framework**: Consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
- **Components of the CSF**:
  - **Core**
  - **Tiers**
  - **Profiles**

### The Core
- **Simplified Security Functions**: Identifies five broad functions.
  - **Identify**: Understanding the environment to manage cybersecurity risk.
  - **Protect**: Safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.
  - **Detect**: Identifying the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - **Respond**: Taking action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.
  - **Recover**: Plans for resilience and restoration of capabilities or services.

### Tiers
- **Performance Measurement**: Tiers provide a way to measure performance across the five core functions.
  - **Level-1 (Passive)**: Bare minimum standards.
  - **Level-2 (Risk-Informed)**: Risk management practices are approved but not implemented organization-wide.
  - **Level-3 (Repeatable)**: Risk management practices are formally approved and expressed as policy.
  - **Level-4 (Adaptive)**: Risk management practices are adaptive and continuously improving.

### Profiles
- **Insight into Security Plans**: Profiles capture the current state of a security plan, allowing for comparisons over time.
- **Analogy**: Like photos capturing moments in time, providing useful insights when compared.

## Key Takeaways
- **Good Security Practice**: It's about more than avoiding fines and attacks; it shows care for people and their information.
- **CSF Core Functions**: Understanding the core functions helps to navigate through the different aspects of cybersecurity.
  - **Identify**: Relates to asset management and risk assessment.
  - **Protect**: Focus on safeguards for critical infrastructure services.

## Conclusion
- **Compliance**: Ensuring everyone follows the security plan is crucial.
- **Framework Components**: Understanding the CSF's core, tiers, and profiles is essential for effective cybersecurity management.
