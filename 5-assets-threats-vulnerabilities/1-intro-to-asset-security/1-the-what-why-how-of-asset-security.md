# The What, Why, and How of Asset Security

## Overview
In the field of security, planning for the future is crucial. Security practitioners must constantly practice their skills to handle uncertainties and solve problems before they arise. This involves focusing on risk, which can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.

## Core Concepts

### Security Risk Planning
- **Purpose**: Protect the three components of the CIA triad:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
  - **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
  - **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when needed.

### Elements of Security Plans
Security plans are based on the analysis of three key elements: assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. These elements represent the what, why, and how of security.

1. **Assets**
   - **Definition**: Items perceived as having value to an organization.
   - **Examples**: Buildings, equipment, data, people.
   - **Prioritization**: Security plans prioritize resources to protect assets based on their value and the likelihood of being targeted. For example, the front door of a house is prioritized over the walls because it is more likely to be used for entry by a burglar.

2. **Threats**
   - **Definition**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
   - **Examples**: 
     - **Physical Threats**: Burglars, strong winds, accidental damage.
     - **Cyber Threats**: Malware, phishing attacks, hacking attempts.
   - **Impact**: Threats can exploit vulnerabilities to cause harm to assets.

3. **Vulnerabilities**
   - **Definition**: Weaknesses that can be exploited by threats.
   - **Examples**: 
     - **Physical Vulnerabilities**: Weak locks, cracked wood on a door.
     - **Cyber Vulnerabilities**: Outdated software, weak passwords.
   - **Consideration**: Vulnerabilities need to be identified and mitigated to protect assets from potential threats.

## Conclusion
Security teams must account for a wide range of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to effectively plan for the future and protect organizational assets. Understanding these core elements and how they interact is essential for developing robust security plans.
