# Assets in a Digital World

## Introduction
- Security asset management and the importance of protecting organizational assets.
- Assets are classified based on value.
- Focus on understanding what makes an asset valuable, especially in terms of information.

## Importance of Information
- **Information** is often the most valuable aspect of an asset.
- Most information is in **digital form**, referred to as **data**.
- **Data**: Information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer.

## Challenges of Digital Assets
- Digital assets have additional challenges compared to physical assets.
- Protecting data depends on its state:
  - **In Use**
  - **In Transit**
  - **At Rest**

## States of Data
1. **Data in Use**
   - **Definition**: Data being accessed by one or more users.
   - **Example**: Checking email on a laptop in a park. The inbox is considered to be in use as soon as you log in.
2. **Data in Transit**
   - **Definition**: Data traveling from one point to another.
   - **Example**: Sending a reply to an email. The message is data in transit when you click send.
3. **Data at Rest**
   - **Definition**: Data not currently being accessed, typically stored on a physical device.
   - **Example**: Closing the laptop after checking email. The data in the laptop is at rest as you move to a cafe.

## Information Security (InfoSec)
- **InfoSec**: The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.
- **Importance**:
  - Prevents identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.
  - Protects organizations, partners, and customers.

## Adapting to the Digital World
- The concept of data at rest is evolving with technology.
- **Cloud Storage**: Data is often stored in the cloud, meaning it may not be at rest even if the physical device is inactive.
- Security teams must adapt to new vulnerabilities as the digital world becomes more connected.

## Key Takeaways
- Protecting data depends on where it is and what it is doing.
- Understanding the three states of
