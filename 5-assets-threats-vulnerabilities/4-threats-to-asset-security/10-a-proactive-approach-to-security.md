# A Proactive Approach to Security

Preparing for attacks is a crucial responsibility for the entire security team. Threat actors have many tools and techniques at their disposal, and the nature of the attack can vary depending on the target. For example, attacking a small business can be different from attacking a public utility. Each has different assets and specific defenses to keep them safe. In all cases, anticipating attacks is the key to preparing for them. In security, this anticipation is achieved through a process known as threat modeling.

## Threat Modeling

**Threat modeling** is the process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats. This process is applied to everything that needs protection, including entire systems, applications, or business processes. Creating threat models is a detailed and lengthy activity typically performed by experienced security professionals, but involvement in this process is valuable at all levels.

## Threat Modeling Frameworks

There are several threat modeling frameworks used in the field, each suited for different aspects of security:
- **Network security**
- **Information security**
- **Application development**

## Steps in Threat Modeling

In general, there are six steps involved in creating a threat model:

### 1. Define the Scope
- Determine what is being protected by creating an inventory of assets and classifying them.

### 2. Identify Threats
- Define all potential threat actors, which can be internal or external.
  - **Internal threat actor**: An employee who intentionally exposes an asset to harm.
  - **External threat actor**: A malicious hacker or a competing business.

### 3. Construct an Attack Tree
- Create a diagram that maps threats to assets, detailing all possible attack vectors.

### 4. Characterize the Environment
- Apply an attacker mindset to the business, considering how customers, employees, external partners, and third-party vendors interact with the environment.

### 5. Analyze Threats
- Examine existing protections and identify gaps.
- Rank threats according to their risk score.

### 6. Mitigate Risk
- Develop a plan for defending against threats.
- Decide on actions to avoid, transfer, reduce, or accept the risks.

### 7. Evaluate Findings
- Document the entire exercise, apply fixes, and note successes and lessons learned to inform future threat models.

## Key Takeaways

- **Threat modeling** is a comprehensive approach to understanding and mitigating risks by anticipating potential attacks.
- The process involves a detailed analysis of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, followed by strategic planning to address identified risks.
- Collaboration with various stakeholders, including application developers and external partners, is essential to ensure a robust security posture.

By understanding and participating in threat modeling, security professionals can better prepare for and defend against potential attacks, thereby enhancing the overall security of their organization.
