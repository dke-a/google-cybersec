# Social Engineering Tactics

Social engineering attacks are popular among threat actors because it's often easier to trick people than to exploit software or network vulnerabilities. 

## What is Social Engineering?

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. It's designed to capitalize on the trusting nature of people and their willingness to help.

## Social Engineering Risks

Social engineering takes advantage of people's natural curiosity, generosity, and excitement. These attacks can be highly effective and do not require sophisticated computer skills.

### Example: Twitter Hack of 2020
Hackers called Twitter employees pretending to be from IT, gaining access to the network and internal tools, and took over high-profile accounts. [Read more about the Twitter Hack](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/Twitter_Report).

## Signs of an Attack

Recognizing social engineering signs can reduce successful attacks:

- **Baiting**: Tempts people into compromising security, like USB baiting.
- **Phishing**: Uses digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data, often via email.
- **Quid pro quo**: Tricks someone into believing theyâ€™ll be rewarded for sharing information.
- **Tailgating**: Unauthorized individuals follow authorized people into restricted areas.
- **Watering hole**: Compromises frequently visited websites by a specific group to deliver malicious software.

## Encouraging Caution

### Security Training Focus Areas:

1. **Stay alert**: Be wary of suspicious communications and unknown people.
2. **Be cautious**: Avoid sharing too much information, especially on social media.
3. **Control curiosity**: Be skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true.

### Pro Tip:
Implement technologies like firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), block lists, and email filtering to add layers of defense.

### Extending Awareness:
Educate both employees and customers about social engineering threats to mitigate risks. Security analysts play a key role in promoting safe practices.
