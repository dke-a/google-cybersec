# The Rise of Cryptojacking

Malware has been around nearly as long as computers. Initially, it was used by troublemakers as a form of digital vandalism. Today, malware has become a profitable crime for attackers.

As a security professional, it's important to remain aware of the latest evolutions. Let's take a closer look at cryptojacking, a modern type of malware, and consider how malware can be spotted and how you can proactively protect against it.

## Cryptojacking

**Cryptojacking** is a form of malware that installs software to illegally mine cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money with real-world value, and there are many different types, often referred to as coins or tokens.

### Crypto Mining

Crypto mining involves using computers to process encrypted code. The more computers mining, the more cryptocurrency can be discovered. Criminals exploit this by c cryptojacking malware to gain unauthorized control of personal computers for mining.

### Evolution of Cryptojacking

- **2017 Onwards**: Cryptojacking malware started gaining traction.
- **Targets**: Vulnerable servers, with devices communicating with infected servers becoming infected themselves.
- **Operation**: Malicious code runs in the background, mining for coins without the user's knowledge.

## Detection and Signs of Cryptojacking

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. It helps detect abnormal activities, such as malware mining for coins, by alerting security personnel.

### Signs of Cryptojacking Infection

- **System Slowdown**: The most telling sign.
- **Increased CPU Usage**: High resource consumption due to mining.
- **Sudden System Crashes**: Unstable system performance.
- **Fast Draining Batteries**: Especially noticeable in laptops and mobile devices.
- **High Electricity Costs**: Due to the resource-intensive process of crypto mining.

## Prevention Measures

To reduce the likelihood of experiencing a malware attack like cryptojacking, consider these defenses:

- **Browser Extensions**: Use extensions designed to block malware.
- **Ad Blockers**: Prevent unwanted ads that may contain malicious code.
- **Disable JavaScript**: Reduce the attack surface in web browsers.
- **Stay Alert**: Keep informed about the latest malware trends.
- **Education**: Security analysts can educate others in their organizations about malware attacks.

## Key Takeaways

Cryptojacking is relatively new, but attacks are becoming more common. The type of malicious code cybercriminals use is continually evolving. While it takes many years of experience to analyze new forms of malware, you are well on your way towards helping defend against these threats.
