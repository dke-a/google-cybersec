# The Criminal Art of Persuasion

## Overview

Cybercriminals aren't always the stereotypical hackers hunched over computers. Many use manipulation techniques that don't require advanced programming skills. One such technique is social engineering, which exploits human error to gain access to private information, systems, or valuables.

## Social Engineering

**Definition**: Social engineering is a manipulation technique that tricks people into breaking normal security procedures, leading to data exposures, malware infections, or unauthorized system access.

### Tactics

- **In-person interactions**: Impersonating tech support to obtain passwords.
- **Online interactions**: Monitoring social media to exploit new or temporary employees.

### Stages of Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Preparation**: Gather information about the target.
2. **Establish Trust (Pretexting)**: Use gathered information to open communication and build trust.
3. **Persuasion**: Manipulate the target to volunteer information using specific vocabulary.
4. **Disconnection**: Break communication and disappear after collecting the desired information.

## Prevention

- **Managerial Controls**: Implement policies, standards, and procedures. For example, the NIST Special Publication 800-40 for patch management.
- **Staying Informed**: Security professionals should stay updated on trends and share knowledge with others to raise awareness.

### Key Points

- **Threat Identification**: Recognize social engineering attacks by understanding the stages and tactics used by attackers.
- **Education and Awareness**: Teach employees the signs of an attack to prevent manipulation and unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

Social engineering poses significant threats to both individuals and organizations by using manipulation to bypass security measures. Understanding and recognizing these techniques, along with implementing preventive measures, can help defend against such attacks.
