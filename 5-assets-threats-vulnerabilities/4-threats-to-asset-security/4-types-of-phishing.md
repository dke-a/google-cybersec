# Types of Phishing

Phishing is a common type of social engineering that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. It uses digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. This reading explores various phishing tactics used by attackers today.

## The Origins of Phishing

Phishing dates back to the 1990s, coinciding with the rise of the internet. Early phishing attacks targeted users of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), tricking them into providing personal billing information by pretending to be service providers. This was one of the first examples of **mass phishing**—sending malicious emails to many people to increase the chance of success. Attackers used stolen information to create fraudulent AOL accounts for further crimes.

## Evolution of Phishing

Phishing techniques have evolved with the digital landscape. Here are five common types of phishing:

1. **Email Phishing**: Attackers send emails pretending to be trusted entities.
2. **Smishing**: Phishing through SMS and other text messaging services like iMessages and WhatsApp.
3. **Vishing**: Voice phishing using calls or voice messages to trick targets.
4. **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals, such as small business accountants.
5. **Whaling**: A subset of spear phishing targeting high-ranking executives.

### Early 2000s Techniques

As e-commerce and online payment systems became popular, new phishing techniques emerged. Attackers created fraudulent websites resembling legitimate businesses and launched mass phishing campaigns against e-commerce and banking sites.

### Recent Trends

Starting in the 2010s, attackers shifted to **targeted phishing** using highly customized methods to create a sense of familiarity. 

**Angler Phishing**: Attackers impersonate customer service representatives on social media, intercept complaints, and trick customers into sharing sensitive information by promising to resolve their issues.

## Key Takeaways

Phishing tactics have become sophisticated over the years. There isn't a perfect solution to prevent these attacks, but spreading awareness and informing others can mitigate their impact. As a security professional, you may be responsible for creating training programs to educate employees about phishing and other social engineering forms.
