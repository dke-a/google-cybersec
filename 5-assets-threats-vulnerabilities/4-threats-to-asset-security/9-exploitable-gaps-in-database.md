# Exploitable Gaps in Databases

In this section, we'll explore another common type of web-based exploit: SQL injection. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. Many web applications use SQL, especially shopping websites that manage inventories and user interactions.

## Understanding SQL and Its Usage

SQL is essential for web applications to handle data. For example, an online clothing store's database might contain a full inventory of all items available for sale. Users interact with the database through menus, images, and buttons, which trigger SQL queries in the background. These queries manage user requests like adding items to a shopping cart without requiring manual SQL input from the user.

## SQL Injection Attacks

**SQL injection** is an attack that executes unexpected queries on a database due to a lack of sanitized input. Injection attacks exploit areas of a website designed to accept user input, such as login forms. When a user inputs data, it is incorporated into a backend SQL statement. Vulnerable websites insert the user's input exactly as entered, running the code without validation.

### Example of a SQL Injection

Consider a login form that triggers a SQL query when a user enters their credentials. A typical vulnerable SQL statement might look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'password';

```

If the website doesn't sanitize the input, an attacker might insert additional SQL code to manipulate the query, such as:

```sql

' OR '1'='1

```

This could alter the query to:

```sql

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '';

```

This condition always evaluates to true, potentially granting the attacker access to the database.

### Consequences of SQL Injection

Malicious hackers can exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities to:

- Obtain sensitive information
- Modify database tables
- Gain administrative rights to the database

## Defending Against SQL Injection

The best defense against SQL injection is sanitizing user input. Developers can write code to search for specific SQL characters and use **prepared statements** to validate inputs before passing them to the server.

### Prepared Statements

A **prepared statement** is a coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them to the database. This ensures the input is validated, reducing the risk of SQL injection. Here’s how it works:

1. The prepared statement defines the SQL query with placeholders for user inputs.
2. The code validates the inputs before including them in the SQL query.
3. The validated query is then executed on the server.

### Example of a Prepared Statement

```python
# Example in Python using a SQL library
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))

```

In this example, `%s` acts as a placeholder, and the actual user inputs are passed separately, ensuring they are validated and sanitized before execution.

## Team Effort in Preventing SQL Injection

Preventing SQL injection and other web-based exploits is a team effort involving both security teams and program developers. Security teams work with developers to test applications for vulnerabilities, ensuring robust and secure code.

## Key Takeaways

- **SQL Injection:** A significant web-based exploit that occurs due to unsanitized user input.
- **Prepared Statements:** A defensive coding technique to prevent SQL injection.
- **Team Effort:** Collaboration between security teams and developers is crucial for identifying and mitigating web-based exploits.

Understanding SQL injection and implementing proper defenses like prepared statements are critical for maintaining database security and preventing unauthorized access.
