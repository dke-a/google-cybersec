# PASTA: The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

**PASTA** is a popular threat modeling framework used across various industries to identify and mitigate security threats. PASTA stands for **Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis** and consists of seven stages. Let's explore each stage using a real-world scenario where a fitness company is preparing to launch their first mobile app.

## 1. Define Business and Security Objectives
- **Goal:** Protect customer data.
- **Actions:** 
  - Ask questions to understand how personally identifiable information (PII) is handled.
  - Evaluate the impact of potential threats on customer data.

## 2. Define the Technical Scope
- **Goal:** Identify application components for evaluation.
- **Actions:** 
  - Focus on the attack surface.
  - Include technology involved while data is at rest and in use, such as network protocols, security controls, and data interactions.

## 3. Decompose the Application
- **Goal:** Identify existing controls protecting user data.
- **Actions:** 
  - Work with application developers to create a data flow diagram.
  - Show data flow from the user's device to the company's database.
  - Identify controls in place to protect data along the way.

## 4. Perform a Threat Analysis
- **Goal:** Understand and simulate potential attacks.
- **Actions:** 
  - Adopt an attacker mindset.
  - Research the most up-to-date information on attack vectors for mobile apps.

## 5. Perform a Vulnerability Analysis
- **Goal:** Investigate potential vulnerabilities more deeply.
- **Actions:** 
  - Consider the root cause of vulnerabilities.

## 6. Conduct Attack Modeling
- **Goal:** Test identified vulnerabilities by simulating attacks.
- **Actions:** 
  - Create an attack tree to model potential attack vectors.
  - Example: Target customer information stored in a database.
    - Identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection due to unsanitized inputs.
    - Use attack trees to identify and validate attack vectors that need testing.

## 7. Analyze Risk and Impact
- **Goal:** Make informed risk management recommendations.
- **Actions:** 
  - Assemble all information from previous stages.
  - Provide recommendations to business stakeholders that align with business goals.

## Key Takeaways
- **PASTA** is a comprehensive threat modeling framework that helps security teams identify and mitigate security threats.
- The seven stages of PASTA guide teams through defining objectives, identifying and analyzing threats, and making informed risk management decisions.
- Collaboration with various stakeholders, including application developers, is essential for a thorough threat modeling process.

By following the PASTA framework, security teams can ensure they are well-prepared to protect their applications and customer data from potential threats.
