# An Introduction to Malware

Previously, you learned that **malware** is software designed to harm devices or networks. Since its first appearance on personal computers decades ago, malware has developed into a variety of strains. Being able to identify different types of malware and understand the ways in which they are spread will help you stay alert and be informed as a security professional.

## Virus

A **virus** is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. This type of malware must be installed by the target user before it can spread itself and cause damage. Viruses are often spread through phishing campaigns where malicious links are hidden within links or attachments.

## Worm

A **worm** is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. Similar to a virus, a worm must be installed by the target user and can also be spread with tactics like malicious email. Worms can spread across networked devices without user action. An example is the Blaster worm, which spread rapidly among Windows XP and Windows 2000 systems.

**Note:** Worms were very popular in the mid-2000s but are less frequently used in recent years.

## Trojan

A **trojan**, also called a **Trojan horse**, is malware that looks like a legitimate file or program. Attackers deliver this type of malware hidden in file and application downloads, tricking users into installing it. Trojans can be used to spy on users, grant access to other devices, and more.

## Adware

**Adware** is software designed to display advertisements. While some adware is legitimate and helps developers monetize their products, malicious adware falls into a sub-category of malware known as **potentially unwanted applications (PUAs)**. These can display ads, cause device slowdowns, or install other software without consent.

## Spyware

**Spyware** is malware used to gather and sell information without consent. It is often hidden in **bundleware**, additional software packaged with other applications. Spyware collects data such as login credentials and account PINs for personal gain.

## Scareware

**Scareware** employs tactics to frighten users into infecting their own devices. It displays fake warnings that appear to come from legitimate companies. Email and pop-ups are common ways scareware is spread, delivering false claims about the user's files or data being at risk.

## Fileless Malware

**Fileless malware** uses legitimate programs already installed to infect a computer, residing in memory and never touching the hard drive. It is detected by performing memory analysis, requiring experience with operating systems.

## Rootkits

A **rootkit** provides remote, administrative access to a computer, often used to open a backdoor for installing other malware or conducting network attacks. Rootkits are spread using a combination of a **dropper** (malware disguised as a legitimate file) and a **loader** (downloads malicious code from an external source).

## Botnet

A **botnet**, short for "robot network," is a collection of infected computers under the control of a single threat actor, the "bot-herder." Botnets use viruses, worms, and trojans to spread, turning devices into bots that report back to the bot-herder for executing commands.

## Ransomware

**Ransomware** is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. These attacks are increasingly sophisticated and can cause significant damage, as seen in the [WannaCry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack) attack, which demanded cryptocurrency ransoms.

## Key Takeaways

The variety of malware is astounding, and the number of ways it spreads is staggering. Malware is a complex threat that can require its own specialization in cybersecurity. Recognizing the types of malware and how they spread is essential for defending against these attacks.
