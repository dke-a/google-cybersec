# Phishing for Information

Cybercriminals prefer attacks that do the most damage with the least effort. **Phishing** is a popular form of social engineering that meets this description.

## What is Phishing?

**Phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. Though it leverages many communication technologies, it is mainly used to describe attacks that arrive by email.

### Impact on Individuals and Organizations

Phishing attacks can give attackers access to sensitive data like customer names and product secrets by exploiting a single employee's mistake.

## Phishing Kits

Attackers use **phishing kits**, which are collections of software tools needed to launch a phishing campaign. These kits allow individuals with little technical background to launch effective phishing attacks. 

### Components of a Phishing Kit

1. **Malicious Attachments**: Files that are infected and can harm an organization's systems.
2. **Fake Data Collection Forms**: Forms that look legitimate but ask for sensitive information not typically requested in an email.
3. **Fraudulent Web Links**: Links to malicious web pages designed to steal information like login credentials.

## Types of Phishing Attacks

### Malicious Emails

The most common form, where attackers use the components of phishing kits to send harmful emails.

### Smishing

**Smishing** (SMS phishing) uses text messages to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source. These messages can appear legitimate, sometimes even using local area codes or appearing to come from friends or family.

### Vishing

**Vishing** (voice phishing) exploits electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information. Attackers may call pretending to be company representatives, claiming there's a problem with your account and offering to fix it if you provide sensitive information.

## Prevention Measures

### Anti-Phishing Policies

Organizations implement anti-phishing policies to spread awareness and encourage correct data security procedures.

### Employee Training

Regular training helps employees recognize suspicious emails and other forms of phishing.

### Securing Email Inboxes

- **Email Filters**: Used to block harmful messages from reaching users. Blocklists can block specific email addresses, while allowlists specify approved IP addresses for sending mail within the company.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems**: Monitor email traffic for unusual patterns, quarantine suspicious emails, and produce logs of events.

## Key Takeaways

Phishing campaigns are a prevalent and dangerous form of social engineering that organizations must defend against. Understanding the tools and techniques attackers use can help you spot and prevent phishing attacks.
