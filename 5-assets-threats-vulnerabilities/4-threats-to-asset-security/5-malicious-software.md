# Malicious Software

Malicious software, or **malware**, is designed to harm devices or networks. Malware can be spread in various ways, such as through infected USB drives or online. When a device becomes infected, malware disrupts normal operations, allowing attackers to take control without the user's knowledge or permission. Below are five common types of malware and their characteristics.

## Types of Malware

### 1. Virus
- **Definition**: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
- **Spread**: Hides inside trusted applications. When the infected program is launched, the virus clones itself and spreads to other files on the device.
- **Activation**: Requires user action to start the infection.

### 2. Worm
- **Definition**: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own.
- **Spread**: Uses an infected device as a host, scans the connected network for other devices, and infects everything without user action.

### 3. Trojan (Trojan Horse)
- **Definition**: Malware that appears to be a legitimate file or program.
- **Origin**: Named after the ancient Greek legend of soldiers hiding inside a giant wooden horse presented as a gift.
- **Function**: Disguises as harmless files or applications to trick targets into installing them.
- **Purpose**: Often used to gain access and install other malware, like ransomware.

### 4. Ransomware
- **Definition**: Malicious software that encrypts an organization's data and demands payment to restore access.
- **Characteristics**: Makes itself known to the target to demand payment. Decrypts data once the ransom is paid, but thereâ€™s no guarantee against repeated attacks.

### 5. Spyware
- **Definition**: Malware used to gather and sell information without consent.
- **Function**: Collects data like login credentials and account PINs for personal gain.
- **Comparison**: Unlike organizations that allow customers to opt-out of data collection, spyware steals information without permission.

## Key Points
- **Infection Methods**: Malware can be delivered through phishing emails, infected USB drives, and disguised applications.
- **Risks**: Malware poses serious risks to both individuals and organizations, affecting data security and operational integrity.
- **Evolution**: New forms of malware continuously evolve, presenting ongoing challenges for security teams.
