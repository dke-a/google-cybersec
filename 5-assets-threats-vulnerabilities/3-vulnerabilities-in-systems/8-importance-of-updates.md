# The Importance of Updates

## Purpose of Updates
Updates enhance performance, stability, and security by addressing vulnerabilities that can risk users, devices, and networks.

## Security Role of Updates
Updates are part of a remediation strategy, usually following a **vulnerability assessment**. They fix gaps in security, similar to locking doors to prevent unauthorized access.

### Patch Updates
- **Patch update**: Fixes security vulnerabilities within software or operating systems.
- **Zero-day**: Exploits previously unknown vulnerabilities, prompting urgent patches.

## Update Strategies
Updates can be installed manually or automatically, each with pros and cons.

### Manual Updates
- **Advantage**: Control over installation, useful if updates are not well-tested.
- **Disadvantage**: Risk of forgetting or disregarding critical updates.

### Automatic Updates
- **Advantage**: Simplifies the update process and ensures critical patches are applied.
- **Disadvantage**: Potential instability if patches are not thoroughly tested.
- **CISA Recommendation**: Use automatic updates when possible for enhanced security.

## End-of-Life (EOL) Software
- **Lifecycle**: Software starts at production and ends when newer versions are released.
- **Risk**: EOL software is no longer supported, posing unfixable security risks.
- **CISA Recommendation**: Discontinue use of EOL software to avoid security vulnerabilities.

## Key Takeaways
- Regular updates and patches are essential to prevent cyber attacks.
- Example: The WannaCry attack in 2017 could have been prevented with timely updates, highlighting the importance of keeping systems current.

By keeping software updated, users can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and maintain a secure computing environment.
