# Penetration Testing

Penetration testing evaluates the effectiveness of an organization's defenses by simulating attacks.

## What is Penetration Testing?
A penetration test (pen test) is a simulated attack to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It uses the same tools and techniques as malicious actors to mimic a real-life attack. Unlike vulnerability assessments that find weaknesses, pen tests exploit those weaknesses to determine potential consequences.

### Example
A financial company's cybersecurity team might simulate an attack on their banking app to identify weaknesses that could allow data theft or unauthorized fund transfers. If vulnerabilities are found, they can be fixed to enhance security.

**Note:** Organizations regulated by PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR must routinely perform penetration testing.

## Types of Penetration Testing
- **Red Team Tests**: Simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Blue Team Tests**: Focus on defense and incident response.
- **Purple Team Tests**: Combine red and blue team exercises for a comprehensive approach.

### Penetration Testing Strategies
- **Open-box Testing**: Tester has full access to system information, similar to an internal developer (also known as white-box testing).
- **Closed-box Testing**: Tester has no access to internal systems, similar to a real attacker (also known as black-box testing).
- **Partial Knowledge Testing**: Tester has limited access, like a specific user role (also known as gray-box testing).

## Becoming a Penetration Tester
Skills needed include:
- Network and application security
- Operating systems (e.g., Linux)
- Vulnerability analysis and threat modeling
- Detection and response tools
- Programming (e.g., Python, BASH)
- Communication

## Bug Bounty Programs
Organizations run bug bounty programs offering rewards for finding and reporting vulnerabilities. This is a great opportunity for amateur security professionals to develop their skills.

**Pro Tip:** [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com) offers active bug bounties for ethical hackers.

## Key Takeaways
Penetration testing helps organizations secure their systems by simulating attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. There is a growing demand for skilled penetration testers, providing many opportunities to develop and apply these skills.
