## The OWASP Top 10

### Introduction
To prepare for future risks, security professionals need to stay informed. The CVE® list is an openly accessible dictionary of known vulnerabilities and exposures, widely used by the global security community. Another crucial resource is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), a nonprofit foundation focused on improving the security of software. OWASP is an open platform where security professionals share information, tools, and events related to web security.

### What is OWASP?
OWASP is a nonprofit foundation that aims to improve the security of software. It is an open platform used by security professionals worldwide to share information, tools, and events focused on web security.

### The OWASP Top 10
The OWASP Top 10 is a list published by OWASP since 2003 to spread awareness of the web’s most targeted vulnerabilities. This list mainly applies to new or custom-made software. Many of the world's largest organizations reference the OWASP Top 10 during application development to ensure their programs address common security mistakes. The OWASP Top 10 is updated every few years as technologies evolve, with rankings based on the frequency and risk level of the vulnerabilities.

### Common Vulnerabilities
Businesses often make critical security decisions based on the vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10. This resource influences how businesses design new software that will be on their network, unlike the CVE® list, which helps them identify improvements to existing programs. Below are some regularly listed vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10:

#### Broken Access Control
Access controls limit what users can do in a web application. Failures in these mechanisms can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction, and unauthorized access to other business applications.

#### Cryptographic Failures
Vulnerabilities occur when businesses fail to encrypt sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII). For example, using a weak hashing algorithm like MD5 increases the risk of data breaches.

#### Injection
Injection occurs when malicious code is inserted into a vulnerable application, giving attackers a backdoor into an organization’s information system. A common target is a website’s login form.

#### Insecure Design
Applications should be designed to be resilient to attacks. Insecure design refers to a wide range of missing or poorly implemented security controls.

#### Security Misconfiguration
Misconfigurations occur when security settings are not properly set or maintained. A common example is deploying equipment using default settings that fail to meet the organization's security objectives.

#### Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Instead of coding everything from scratch, developers often use open-source libraries. Using vulnerable components that have not been maintained increases the risk of exploitation by threat actors.

#### Identification and Authentication Failures
When applications fail to recognize who should have access and what they’re authorized to do, it can lead to serious problems, such as unauthorized access to a home Wi-Fi network.

#### Software and Data Integrity Failures
These failures occur when updates or patches are inadequately reviewed before implementation, potentially allowing attackers to deliver malicious software. This can lead to supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds cyber attack in 2020.

#### Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Having a record of events like user login attempts is critical for identifying and fixing problems. Sufficient monitoring and incident response are equally important.

#### Server-Side Request Forgery
Server-side request forgeries (SSRFs) occur when attackers manipulate server operations to read or update other resources on the server, often exploiting vulnerable applications.

### Key Takeaways
Staying informed and maintaining awareness about the latest cybersecurity trends is crucial for defending against attacks and preparing for future risks. The OWASP Top 10 is a valuable resource for learning about common vulnerabilities.
