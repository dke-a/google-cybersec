# Protect All Entry Points

## Understanding the Attack Surface

### Definition
- **Attack Surface**: All potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.
- Analyzing the attack surface is usually the first step for security teams.

### Example
- Consider a castle's defenses: giant walls, stone towers, wooden gates. If near the ocean, defenses must include catapults to counter long-range attacks by ships.

## Physical Attack Surface

### Definition
- **Physical Attack Surface**: Consists of people and their devices, vulnerable to attacks from inside and outside the organization.

### Examples
- **External Threat**: An unattended laptop in a public space displaying sensitive information.
- **Internal Threat**: Disgruntled employees sharing private information intentionally.

### Mitigation
- **Security Hardening**: Strengthening a system to reduce vulnerabilities and the attack surface by limiting entry points.
- **Examples**: Organization policies and access controls.

## Digital Attack Surface

### Definition
- **Digital Attack Surface**: Includes everything beyond the organization's firewall, encompassing all online connections to the organization.

### Historical Context
- **Past**: Data stored on on-site servers, accessed through managed workplace networks.
- **Present**: Data stored in the cloud, accessible from anywhere, expanding the digital attack surface.

### Impact
- Cloud computing increases access to information but also expands entry points for threats, putting more pressure on organizations to defend against various attacks.

## Key Takeaways

- **Physical and Digital Attack Surfaces**: Both need thorough analysis and hardening to protect against internal and external threats.
- **Security Hardening**: Essential for minimizing the attack surface by implementing robust security measures.
- **Cloud Computing**: While beneficial for accessibility, it significantly broadens the digital attack surface, requiring enhanced security strategies.
