## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Introduction
Security is a global effort involving individuals and organizations sharing and documenting common vulnerabilities and exposures. This collaborative effort helps in enhancing security across various systems.

### Key Concepts:
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat.
- **Exposure:** A mistake that can be exploited by a threat.

### Example:
- **Scenario:** Protecting an important document.
  - **Vulnerability:** Document can be misplaced.
  - **Exposure:** Document left near an open window, risking it being blown away.

### CVE List
- **Definition:** Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list is an openly accessible dictionary of known vulnerabilities and exposures.
- **Origin:** Created by MITRE corporation in 1999.
- **Purpose:** Standard way of identifying and categorizing known vulnerabilities and exposures.
- **Contributors:** Independent researchers, technology vendors, ethical hackers, and more.

### Review Process
- **CVE Numbering Authority (CNA):** Organizations that analyze and distribute information on eligible CVEs.
- **Criteria for CVE ID Assignment:**
  1. Independent of other issues.
  2. Recognized as a potential security risk.
  3. Submitted with supporting evidence.
  4. Affects only one codebase.

### Vulnerability Databases
- **NIST National Vulnerabilities Database:**
  - Uses the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**.
  - **CVSS:** Scores the severity of a vulnerability on a scale of 0-10.
  - **Scoring:**
    - Below 4.0: Low risk, not requiring immediate attention.
    - Above 9.0: Critical risk, requiring immediate attention.

### Importance of CVE and CVSS
- **Usage:** Part of vulnerability management strategy.
- **Benefits:**
  - Helps prioritize security fixes.
  - Provides recommendations for addressing vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion
Libraries like the CVE list help organizations determine the danger of vulnerabilities and the urgency of addressing them. They bring together diverse perspectives from across the world, contributing significantly to global security efforts.

### Key Takeaways
- Security is a collaborative global effort.
- Vulnerabilities and exposures are documented in public libraries like the CVE list.
- The CVE list and CVSS scores aid in vulnerability management and prioritization.
