# Vulnerability Assessments

## Overview
Our exploration of the vulnerability management process has focused on various topics, including how vulnerabilities influence the design of defenses and how common vulnerabilities are shared. However, a crucial aspect we are yet to cover is how vulnerabilities are found in the first place.

## What is a Vulnerability Assessment?
A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organization's security systems. These assessments work similarly to the process of identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities on the CVE list. The main difference is that the organization's security team performs, evaluates, scores, and fixes them on their own. Security analysts play a key role throughout this process.

## Goals of a Vulnerability Assessment
- **Identify Weak Points**: The primary goal is to identify weak points in the security system and prevent attacks.
- **Regulatory Standards**: These assessments help determine whether security controls meet regulatory standards.
- **Focus Areas**: Given the multitude of assets to protect, security teams sometimes need to select specific areas to focus on during vulnerability assessments.

## The Four-Step Process
### 1. Identification
- **Tools and Testing**: Scanning tools and manual testing are used to find vulnerabilities.
- **Current State Analysis**: This step aims to understand the current state of a security system, akin to taking a snapshot of it.

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis
- **Testing**: Each identified vulnerability is tested to find its source.
- **Digital Detective**: The goal is to act as a digital detective to trace the origin of the problem.

### 3. Risk Assessment
- **Scoring**: A score is assigned to each vulnerability based on:
  - **Impact Severity**: How severe the impact would be if exploited.
  - **Likelihood**: The probability of the vulnerability being exploited.
- **Prioritization**: Helps in prioritizing resources to address the most critical vulnerabilities based on their scores.

### 4. Remediation
- **Addressing Vulnerabilities**: This step involves addressing vulnerabilities that can impact the organization.
- **Joint Effort**: Typically a collaborative effort between security staff and IT teams to devise the best approach to fix the vulnerabilities.
- **Examples**: Remediation steps might include enforcing new security procedures, updating operating systems, or implementing system patches.

## Conclusion
Vulnerability assessments are effective in identifying system flaws, enabling organizations to search for and address problems before they occur. The next focus will be on how companies determine where to search for vulnerabilities.
