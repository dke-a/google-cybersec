## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

### Introduction
Cyber attacks can sometimes be prevented with the right information, which starts with knowing where your systems are vulnerable. While the CVE® list and scanning tools are useful for finding weaknesses, there are other methods to identify vulnerabilities and threats. One such method is open-source intelligence (OSINT).

### What is OSINT?
OSINT stands for open-source intelligence, which involves the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence. It's commonly used to support cybersecurity activities like identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.

### Information vs Intelligence
The terms intelligence and information are often used interchangeably, but they differ in focus and objectives:
- **Information**: The collection of raw data or facts about a specific subject.
- **Intelligence**: The analysis of information to produce knowledge or insights that can support decision-making.

For example, information about an update to an operating system (OS) is raw data. If cybersecurity news resources reveal new threats linked to this update, analyzing this information provides intelligence that guides decisions about installing the updates.

### Intelligence Improves Decision-Making
Businesses use information to gain insights into customer behavior, which then improves decision-making. Similarly, in cybersecurity, open-source information is used to gain insights into threats and vulnerabilities. 

#### Role of OSINT in InfoSec
InfoSec, or information security, is the practice of keeping data secure. OSINT helps by:
- Providing insights into cyber attacks
- Detecting potential data exposures
- Evaluating existing defenses
- Identifying unknown vulnerabilities

For instance, an InfoSec team might use OSINT to monitor online forums and hacker communities for emerging vulnerabilities. Discovering a new software weakness, they can quickly assess the risk, prioritize patches, and implement safeguards.

### OSINT Tools
Given the vast amount of open-source information online, finding relevant information is challenging. Information can be gathered from search engines, social media, discussion boards, blogs, etc. Several tools aid in this process:

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload): Analyzes suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content.
- [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/): A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/): A web-based interface for finding OSINT tools for various sources and platforms.
- [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/): Searches for breached email accounts.

### Key Takeaways
- **Importance of OSINT**: OSINT is crucial for making evidence-based decisions that can prevent cyber attacks.
- **Skill in Searching**: Security professionals must be skilled at searching for relevant information due to the vast amount available.
- **Familiarity with Tools**: Knowing popular OSINT tools and resources eases the process of gathering information and collecting intelligence.

### Conclusion
Gathering information and intelligence are essential aspects of cybersecurity. OSINT helps in making informed decisions to enhance security and prevent attacks. Familiarity with various OSINT tools is critical for effective intelligence gathering.
