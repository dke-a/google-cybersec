# Types of Threat Actors

Anticipating attacks is an important skill for an effective security professional. Developing this skill requires an open and flexible mindset about where attacks can come from. Previously, you learned about **attack surfaces**, which are all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

## Attack Surfaces

- **Attack Surface:** All potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.
  - Examples: Networks, servers, devices, staff.
  - Key to defending: Limiting access to these surfaces.

## Threat Actors

A **threat actor** is any person or group presenting a security risk, including individuals both inside and outside an organization, whether they intentionally or accidentally put assets at risk.

### Categories of Threat Actors

1. **Competitors:**
   - Rival companies that might benefit from leaked information.

2. **State Actors:**
   - Government intelligence agencies.

3. **Criminal Syndicates:**
   - Organized groups making money from criminal activity.

4. **Insider Threats:**
   - Individuals with authorized access who accidentally or intentionally compromise assets.
   - Includes employees who may share private information on purpose.

5. **Shadow IT:**
   - Individuals using technologies that lack IT governance, like personal emails for work-related communications.

### Types of Hackers

1. **Unauthorized Hackers (Unethical Hackers):**
   - Individuals using programming skills to commit crimes.
   - Range from *script kiddies* (limited skills) to highly skilled hackers.

2. **Authorized Hackers (Ethical Hackers):**
   - Individuals using programming skills to improve security.
   - Includes internal security team members, external vendors, and freelancers in bug bounty programs.

3. **Semi-Authorized Hackers:**
   - Individuals who may violate ethical standards without malicious intent.
   - **Hacktivists:** Use skills for political goals, e.g., exposing security risks to raise awareness.

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT):** Instances where a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period.
  - Mostly associated with nation-states and state-sponsored actors.
  - APTs focus on surveillance to gather information and manipulate services.

## Access Points

Threat actors use various attack vectors to gain access:

1. **Direct Access:**
   - Physical access to a system.

2. **Removable Media:**
   - Portable hardware like USB flash drives.

3. **Social Media Platforms:**
   - Used for communication and content sharing.

4. **Email:**
   - Includes both personal and business accounts.

5. **Wireless Networks:**
   - On-premises networks.

6. **Cloud Services:**
   - Provided by third-party organizations.

7. **Supply Chains:**
   - Third-party vendors presenting a backdoor into systems.

## Key Takeaways

- Defending an attack surface starts with thinking like a threat actor.
- Understanding why someone would pose a threat to organizational assets is crucial.
- Recognize that not all threat actors intentionally cause harm.
- Identifying attack vectors and matching them with threat actor intentions is invaluable in developing an attacker mindset.
