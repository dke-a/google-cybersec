# Information Privacy: Regulations and Compliance

## Introduction
Security and privacy have a close relationship. People have the right to control how their personal data is collected and used. Organizations have a responsibility to protect the information they are collecting from being compromised or misused. As a security professional, you will be highly involved in these efforts.

## Information Security vs. Information Privacy
- **Information Privacy**: The protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.
- **Information Security (InfoSec)**: The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

**Key Difference**: Privacy is about providing people with control over their personal information and how it's shared. Security is about protecting peopleâ€™s choices and keeping their information safe from potential threats.

### Example
A retail company collects personal information about its customers for marketing purposes. Customers should be informed about how their information will be used and should be given an option to opt-out. The company should implement security controls to protect this data from unauthorized access and misuse.

## Why Privacy Matters in Security
In the late 1990s, the issue of data security and privacy gained attention. Tech companies started storing and using people's data for business purposes, leading to concerns about data security and privacy. Businesses became more transparent about their data collection and usage practices and implemented security measures to protect people's data privacy.

## Notable Privacy Regulations
Privacy regulations exist to protect a user's information from being collected, used, or shared without their consent. Some influential regulations include:

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Developed by the European Union (EU).
- Puts data owners in control of their personal information, including name, address, phone number, financial, and medical information.
- Applies to any business handling the data of EU citizens or residents, regardless of the business location.

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Formed by major organizations in the financial industry.
- Aims to secure credit and debit card transactions against data theft and fraud.

### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- U.S. law requiring the protection of sensitive patient health information.
- Prohibits the disclosure of a person's medical information without their knowledge and consent.

## Security Assessments and Audits
- **Security Audit**: A review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.
- **Security Assessment**: A check to determine how resilient current security implementations are against threats.

### Example
If a regulation states that multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enabled for all administrator accounts, an audit might check those user accounts for compliance. After the audit, an internal team might assess and find that many users are using weak passwords, leading them to enable MFA on all user accounts.

## Key Takeaways
- Protecting and governing the use of sensitive data maintains customer trust.
- Security professionals should prioritize data privacy.
- Security assessments and audits help evaluate gaps in security plans.
- Delaying or overlooking assessment results can lead to serious business consequences, such as fines or data breaches.

**Pro Tip**: Compliance with legal regulations, such as GDPR, can be determined during audits. Regular security assessments and audits ensure effective protection of everyone's privacy.
