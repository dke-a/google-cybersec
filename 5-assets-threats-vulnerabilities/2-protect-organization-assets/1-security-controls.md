# Security Controls

## Introduction
In today's world, information exists in numerous locations simultaneously. Organizations are under constant pressure to implement effective security controls to protect information from being stolen or exposed. Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks and protect assets before, during, and after an event.

## Types of Security Controls
Security controls can be categorized into three types: technical, operational, and managerial.

### Technical Controls
- **Definition**: Technologies used to protect assets.
- **Examples**:
  - Encryption
  - Authentication systems
  - Firewalls
  - Intrusion detection systems

### Operational Controls
- **Definition**: Activities related to maintaining the day-to-day security environment.
- **Examples**:
  - Security awareness training
  - Incident response
  - Regular security audits
  - Physical security measures (e.g., guards, access control systems)

### Managerial Controls
- **Definition**: Focus on how technical and operational controls reduce risk.
- **Examples**:
  - Security policies
  - Standards and guidelines
  - Procedures
  - Risk management strategies

## Information Privacy
- **Definition**: Protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.
- **Importance**: Ensures the right to decide when, how, and to what extent private information is shared.
- **Role of Security Controls**: Technologies used to regulate information privacy.

### Example Scenario: Travel App
- **Process**: 
  - User books a flight using a travel app.
  - User enters personal information like name, email, and credit card number.
  - Transaction completes successfully, and the flight is booked.
- **Expectation**: Only relevant personnel should have access to specific information.
  - **Customer Support**: May need access to credit card information to assist with reservations.
  - **Marketing Department**: Should not have access to credit card information.

## Principle of Least Privilege
- **Definition**: Limiting access to information based on the user and situation.
- **Objective**: Ensure users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.

## Roles in Information Privacy
### Data Owners
- **Definition**: Individuals who decide who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information.
- **Complexity**: Can involve multiple owners, such as intellectual property of an organization.

### Data Custodians
- **Definition**: Entities responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information.
- **Entities**:
  - People
  - Organizations
  - Systems

## Considerations for Implementing Security Controls
- **Data as an Asset**: Requires proper classification and handling.
- **Information Privacy**: Must be maintained through appropriate security controls.
- **Continuous Exploration**: Ongoing assessment and improvement of security controls to address emerging risks and vulnerabilities.
