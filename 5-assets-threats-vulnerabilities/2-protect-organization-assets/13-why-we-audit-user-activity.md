# Why We Audit User Activity

## Introduction
Monitoring user activity is a crucial part of the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) framework. This reading explores the importance of accounting in security practices and how access logs help identify and mitigate security threats.

## Understanding Accounting
### What is Accounting?
Accounting involves monitoring and recording access logs of a system. These logs provide detailed information about who accessed the system, when they accessed it, and what resources they used.

### Importance of Access Logs
Access logs are essential for security analysts for several reasons:
- **Trend Identification:** Logs help identify patterns, such as repeated failed login attempts.
- **Threat Detection:** They uncover unauthorized access or potential breaches.
- **Incident Investigation:** Analyzing logs is often the first step in investigating security events.

## How Access Logs Work
### Sessions and Session IDs
Whenever a user accesses a system, they initiate a session. A session is a sequence of network HTTP basic authentication requests and responses associated with the same user. The session captures the user's activities from the moment they enter the system until they leave.

- **Session ID:** A unique token generated at the start of a session to identify the user and their device. It remains attached to the user until they close their browser or the session times out.

### Session Cookies
Along with the session ID, session cookies are exchanged between the server and the user's device:
- **Purpose:** Cookies validate the session and determine its duration. They prevent sensitive information like usernames and passwords from being shared.
- **Security Risk:** If an attacker steals a session cookie, they can impersonate the user, leading to session hijacking.

## Session Hijacking
### What is Session Hijacking?
Session hijacking occurs when an attacker obtains a legitimate user's session ID. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user, potentially causing harm such as:
- **Data Theft:** Stolen money or private information.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Access to additional systems, especially if single sign-on (SSO) is used.

### Preventing Session Hijacking
Monitoring access logs for unusual activity can help detect and prevent session hijacking. Recognizing irregularities in log data can indicate improper access or stolen information.

## Key Takeaways
### Importance of Monitoring
- **Security Insight:** Access logs provide valuable insights that help keep information secure.
- **Early Detection:** Regularly analyzing logs can detect potential security incidents early.
- **Incident Response:** Logs are crucial for investigating and responding to security events.

By implementing comprehensive accounting practices, organizations can better protect their systems and data, ensuring that user activities are monitored and any suspicious behavior is promptly addressed.
