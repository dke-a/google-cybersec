# The Data Lifecycle

## Introduction
Organizations handle large amounts of data that must be kept private. Data can be vulnerable whether at rest, in use, or in transit. Regardless of its state, information should be kept private by limiting access and authorization.

## The Data Lifecycle
In security, data vulnerabilities are often mapped in a model known as the data lifecycle. Each stage of the data lifecycle plays an important role in the security controls that are put in place to maintain the CIA triad of information.

### Stages of the Data Lifecycle
The data lifecycle has five stages, describing how data flows through an organization from creation until it is no longer useful:
1. **Collect**: Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Store**: Saving data securely.
3. **Use**: Accessing and utilizing data for various purposes.
4. **Archive**: Moving data to long-term storage for future reference.
5. **Destroy**: Safely disposing of data that is no longer needed.

## Data Governance
Businesses handle massive amounts of data daily. New information is constantly being collected from internal and external sources. A structured approach to managing all this data is the best way to keep it private and secure.

### Definition
Data governance is a set of processes that define how an organization manages information. It includes policies specifying how to keep data private, accurate, available, and secure throughout its lifecycle.

### Roles in Data Governance
- **Data Owner**: Decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information.
- **Data Custodian**: Responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information.
- **Data Steward**: Maintains and implements data governance policies set by an organization.

## Protecting Data at Every Stage
Most security plans include a data governance policy that outlines how information will be managed across an organization. These documents clearly define procedures for keeping data safe and place limits on who or what can access data. 

## Legally Protected Information
Data can represent personal thoughts, actions, and choices. Data owners should decide whether or not to share their data. Security professionals must respect these privacy decisions and protect data accordingly.

### Types of Legally Protected Information
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Information used to infer an individual's identity, such as contact or location information.
- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Information related to an individual's health condition, regulated by HIPAA in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU.
- **SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information)**: A specific type of PII that requires stricter handling, such as bank account numbers or login credentials.

## Key Takeaways
Keeping information private is crucial. Many organizations have data governance policies to protect sensitive information. As a data custodian, you will play a key role in keeping information accessible and safe throughout its lifecycle. Understanding various types of information and controls is essential in the field of security.
