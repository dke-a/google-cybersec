# Principle of Least Privilege

## Introduction
Security controls are essential for keeping sensitive data private and safe. One of the most common controls is the principle of least privilege (PoLP), also known as least privilege. This security concept involves granting users only the minimum level of access and authorization required to complete a task or function. 

Least privilege is a fundamental security control that supports the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad of information. This guide explores how PoLP reduces risk, how it is commonly implemented, and why it should be routinely audited.

## Limiting Access Reduces Risk
Every business must plan for the risk of data theft, misuse, or abuse. Implementing the principle of least privilege can greatly reduce the risk of costly incidents like data breaches by:
- Limiting access to sensitive information.
- Reducing the chances of accidental data modification, tampering, or loss.
- Supporting system monitoring and administration.

Least privilege reduces the likelihood of a successful attack by connecting specific resources to specific users and limiting their actions. It is an important security control that should be applied to any asset. Clearly defining who or what your users are is usually the first step in implementing least privilege effectively.

## Determining Access and Authorization
To implement least privilege, access and authorization must first be determined by asking:
1. **Who is the user?**
2. **How much access do they need to a specific resource?**

### Types of User Accounts
Determining who the user is usually straightforward. A user can refer to a person, like a customer, an employee, or a vendor. It can also refer to a device or software connected to your business network. In general, every user should have their own account, which is typically stored and managed within an organization's directory service. Common types of user accounts include:
- **Guest Accounts**: Provided to external users like customers, clients, contractors, or business partners.
- **User Accounts**: Assigned to staff based on their job duties.
- **Service Accounts**: Granted to applications or software that need to interact with other software on the network.
- **Privileged Accounts**: Have elevated permissions or administrative access.

### Best Practices
Determine a baseline access level for each account type before implementing least privilege. However, access levels may change based on the context. For example, a customer support representative should only have access to customer information while assisting that customer. Least privilege can only reduce risk if user accounts are routinely and consistently monitored.

### Pro Tip
Passwords play an important role when implementing the principle of least privilege. Even if user accounts are assigned appropriately, an insecure password can compromise your systems.

## Auditing Account Privileges
Setting up the right user accounts and assigning appropriate privileges is a helpful first step. Periodically auditing those accounts is key to maintaining secure systems. There are three common approaches to auditing user accounts:
1. **Usage Audits**: Review which resources each account is accessing and what the user is doing with the resource.
2. **Privilege Audits**: Assess whether a user's role aligns with the resources they have access to, addressing issues like privilege creep.
3. **Account Change Audits**: Audit directory records and logs for suspicious activity, ensuring all account changes are made by authorized users.

### Note
Most directory services can be configured to alert system administrators of suspicious activity.

## Key Takeaways
The principle of least privilege is a security control that can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources. Setting up and configuring user accounts with the right levels of access and authorization is an important step toward implementing least privilege. Auditing user accounts and revoking unnecessary access rights helps maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
